    <title>Bounds on Discrete Fourier Transform of Random Mask</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes some bounds on the maximum of magnitude of a random mask
in Fourier domain. The random mask is used in random sampling scheme. Having a
bound on the maximum value of a random mask in Fourier domain is very useful
for some iterative recovery methods that use thresholding operator. In this
paper, we propose some different bounds and compare them with the empirical
examples.

    <title>Time-Reversal Routing for Dispersion Code Multiple Access (DCMA)
  Communications</title>
    <summary>  We present the modeling and characterization of a time-reversal routing
dispersion code multiple access (TR-DCMA) system. We show that this system
maintains the low complexity advantage of DCMA transceivers while offering
dynamic adaptivity for practial communication scenarios. We first derive the
mathematical model and explain operation principles of the system, and then
characterize its interference, signal to interference ratio, and bit error
probability characteristics.

  QAM Systems</title>
    <summary>  We present steepest descent (SD) implementation of multimodulus algorithm
(MMA2-2) for blind signal retrieval in digital communication systems. In
comparison to stochastic approximate (gradient descent) realization, the
proposed SD implementation of MMA2-2 equalizer mitigates inter-symbol
interference with relatively smooth convergence and superior steady-state

    <title>SER for Optimal Combining in Rician Fading with Co-channel Interference</title>
    <summary>  Approximate Symbol error rate (SER) expressions are derived for receive
diversity system employing optimum combining, when both the desired and the
interfering signals are subjected to Rician fading, for the case of a) equal
power uncorrelated interferers b) unequal power interferers c) interferer
correlation. The derived expressions are applicable for an arbitrary number of
receive antennas and interferers and for any QAM constellation. Furthermore, we
derive a simple closed form expression for SER in the interference-limited
regime, for the special case of Rayleigh faded interferers. A close match is
observed between the SER result obtained through the derived analytical
expression and the one obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for a variety of
QAM constellations.

    <title>Optimal Training for Residual Self-Interference for Full Duplex One-way
  Relays</title>
    <summary>  Optimal training design and maximum likelihood channel estimation for one-way
amplify-and-forward full duplex relay systems are proposed. The destination
estimates the residual self-interference (RSI) channel as well as the
end-to-end channel of the relay system, aiming to cancel the RSI through
equalization. The log-likelihood function is maximized through a quasi-Newton
method, with an MMSE-based initialization. The Cramer-Rao bounds are derived to
evaluate the accuracy of the estimates. By using Szeg\"{o}'s theorems about
Toeplitz matrices, we minimize the Cramer-Rao bounds and find the corresponding
optimal training sequences. Extensions of our method to frequency selective
channels and multiple relays are also presented.

    <title>Optimized Sparse Projections for Compressive Sensing</title>
    <summary>  We consider designing a sparse sensing matrix which contains few non-zero
entries per row for compressive sensing (CS) systems. By unifying the previous
approaches for optimizing sensing matrices based on minimizing the mutual
coherence, we propose a general framework for designing a sparse sensing matrix
that minimizes the mutual coherence of the equivalent dictionary and is robust
to sparse representation error. An alternating minimization-based algorithm is
proposed for designing sparse sensing matrices. Experiments with real images
show that the obtained sparse sensing matrix (even each row is extremely
sparse) significantly outperforms a random dense sensing matrix in terms of the
signal recovery accuracy.

    <title>Coexistence between Communication and Radar Systems - A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Data traffic demand in cellular networks has been tremendously growing and
has led to creating congested RF environment. Accordingly, innovative
approaches for spectrum sharing have been proposed and implemented to
accommodate several systems within the same frequency band. Spectrum sharing
between radar and communication systems is one of the important research and
development areas. In this paper, we present the fundamental spectrum sharing
concepts and technologies, then we provide an updated and comprehensive survey
of spectrum sharing techniques that have been developed to enable some of the
wireless communication systems to coexist in the same band as radar systems.

    <title>Equalization Methods for NLIN Mitigation</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the potential of adaptive equalization techniques to mitigate
inter-channel nonlinear interference noise (NLIN). We derive a lower bound on
the mutual information of a system using adaptive equalization, showing that
the channel estimation error determines the equalizer's performance. We develop
an adaptive equalization scheme which uses the statistics of the NLIN to obtain
optimal detection, based on Kalman filtering and maximum likelihood sequence
estimation (MLSE). This scheme outperforms commonly used equalizers and
significantly increases performance.

    <title>PSO and CPSO Based Interference Alignment for K-User MIMO Interference
  Channel</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates how to use a metaheuristic based technique, namely
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), in carrying out of Interference Alignment
(IA) for $K$-User MIMO Interference Channel (IC). Despite its increasing
popularity, mainly in wireless communications, IA lacks of explicit and
straightforward design procedures. Indeed, IA design results in complex
optimization tasks involving a large amount of decision variables, together
with a problem of convergence of the IA solutions. In this paper the IA
optimization is performed using PSO and Cooperative PSO (CPSO) more suitable
for large scale optimization, a comparison between the two versions is also
carried out. This approach seems to be promising.

    <title>Analysis of simultaneous 3D positioning and attitude estimation of a
  planar coil using inductive coupling</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, simultaneous estimation of 3D position and attitude of a
single coil using a set of anchors, with known position and magnetic dipole, is
analyzed. Effect of noise and geometric properties of the anchors'
constellation is considered. Several parameters are analyzed and discussed,
including placement of anchors in a single or in multiple orthogonal planes. It
is shown that adding space and orientation diversity anchors may lead to a more
robust performance when the mobile node attitude changes in time.

external quality factor and frequency shift are calculated. The obtained
analytical results are relevant for designing circuit-QED quantum systems and
frequency division multiplexing of superconducting bolometers, detectors and
similar microwave-range multi-pixel devices.

    <summary>  The attenuation of the video pulse with monotonically increasing input
voltage in a transmission lines with an ideal dielectric can be characterized
by "ohmic" voltage drop $U_\sigma$ along the electrodes with finite
conductivity. The exact analytical formulas for the calculations $U_\sigma$ in
coaxial and strip lines with and without taking into account the strong skin
effect have been obtained. These formulas do not depend on the dispersion and
the degree of nonlinearity of the dielectric and therefore is suitable for
evaluating of shock electromagnetic waves attenuation

resonators or oscillators with specific topologies, our definition is
applicable to any oscillator as a figure of merit for its amplitude stability.
It can be formulated rigorously and computed numerically from oscillator
equations. With this definition, we calculate and analyze the Q factors of
several oscillators of different types. The results confirm that the proposed Q
formulation is a useful addition to the characterization techniques for
oscillators.

    <title>Thermal Source Localization Through Infinite-Dimensional Compressed
  Sensing</title>
    <summary>  We propose a scheme utilizing ideas from infinite dimensional compressed
sensing for thermal source localization. Using the soft recovery framework of
one of the authors, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the recovery
performance. In particular, we extend the framework in order to also include
noisy measurements. Further, we conduct numerical experiments, showing that our
proposed method has strong performance, in a wide range of settings. These
include scenarios with few sensors, off-grid source positioning and high noise
levels, both in one and two dimensions.

    <title>A Novel Sparse recovery based DOA estimation algorithm by relaxing the
  RIP constraint</title>
    <summary>  Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of mixed uncorrelated and coherent
sources is a long existing challenge in array signal processing. Application of
compressive sensing to array signal processing has opened up an exciting class
of algorithms. The authors investigated the application of orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP) for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for different
scenarios, especially to tackle the case of coherent sources and observed
inconsistencies in the results. In this paper, a modified OMP algorithm is
proposed to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting maximum variance based
criterion using only one snapshot. This criterion relaxes the imposed
restricted isometry property (RIP) on the measurement matrix to obtain the
sources. It not only uses one snapshot, but also tackles sources irrespective
of their coherency. The condition for the weak-1 RIP on decreased sparsity is
derived and it is shown that how the algorithm gives better result than the OMP
algorithm. With an addition to this, a simple method is also presented to
calculate source distance from the reference point in a uniform linear sensor
array. Numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

    <title>Data Discovery and Anomaly Detection Using Atypicality: Signal
  Processing Methods</title>
    <summary>  The aim of atypicality is to extract small, rare, unusual and interesting
pieces out of big data. This complements statistics about typical data to give
insight into data. In order to find such "interesting" parts of data, universal
approaches are required, since it is not known in advance what we are looking
for. We therefore base the atypicality criterion on codelength. In a prior
paper we developed the methodology for discrete-valued data, and the the
current paper extends this to real-valued data. This is done by using minimum
description length (MDL). We show that this shares a number of theoretical
properties with the discrete-valued case. We develop the methodology for a
number of "universal" signal processing models, and finally apply them to
recorded hydrophone data.

    <title>Optimal Linear Precoding for Indoor Visible Light Communication System</title>
    <summary>  Visible light communication (VLC) is an emerging technique that uses
light-emitting diodes (LED) to combine communication and illumination. It is
considered as a promising scheme for indoor wireless communication that can be
deployed at reduced costs while offering high data rate performance. In this
paper, we focus on the design of the downlink of a multi-user VLC system.
Inherent to multi-user systems is the interference caused by the broadcast
nature of the medium. Linear precoding based schemes are among the most popular
solutions that have recently been proposed to mitigate inter-user interference.
This paper focuses on the design of the optimal linear precoding scheme that
solves the max-min signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) problem. The
performance of the proposed precoding scheme is studied under different working
conditions and compared with the classical zero-forcing precoding. Simulations
have been provided to illustrate the high gain of the proposed scheme.

    <title>SIMO channel performance evaluation on indoor environment at 2.4 GHz</title>
    <summary>  This work presents an experimental study of Single Input Multiple Output
(SIMO) channel performance in indoor radio propagation environment. Indoor
channel measurements at 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band have been performed using a
versatile channel sounder testbed platform. A single transmitting antenna, four
receiving antennas with two proposed geometries and a four-branch receiver
circuitry were used in order to achieve channel sounder measurements exploiting
baseband signal processing techniques. Deep investigation on SIMO wireless
channel performance was realized through three types of metrics which are
signal strength, gain coefficient and capacity. Performance results indicate
SIMO channel capacity enhancement and illustrate differences between the two
proposed geometries.

    <title>Modeling and Analysis of Power Line Communications for Application in
  Smart Grid</title>
    <summary>  Smart grid is an energy infrastructure that increases energy efficiency by
using communication infrastructure, smart meters, smart appliances, automated
control and networking, and more. This paper focuses on the Power Line
Communication (PLC) aspect and technologies used in the smart grid. There are
various challenges and advancements in the smart grid; this research discusses
how PLC can improve smart grid performance. In order to provide applicable
results, practical PLC system parameters and other required data was obtained
from Florida Power and Light (FPL). Modeling of the PLC system with different
types of digital modulations was conducted using MATLAB/Simulink software and
Python. The benefits and design tradeoffs of Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK),
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), and Phase Shift Keying (PSK) are discussed. The
modulation schemes are compared on the basis of their applicability to a
practical PLC network by comparing the results of the simulations

    <title>Interdependence of Transmission Branch Parameters on the Voltage Levels</title>
    <summary>  Transformers and transmission lines are critical components of a grid
network. This paper analyzes the statistical properties of the electrical
parameters of transmission branches and especially examines their
interdependence on the voltage levels. Some interesting findings include: (a)
with appropriate conversion of MVA rating, a transformers per unit reactance
exhibits consistent statistical pattern independent of voltage levels and
capacity; (b) the distributed reactance (ohms/km) of transmission lines also
has some consistent patterns regardless of voltage levels; (c) other parameters
such as the branch resistance, the MVA ratings, the transmission line length,
etc, manifest strong interdependence on the voltage levels which can be
approximated by a power function with different power constants. The results
will be useful in both creation of synthetic power grid test cases and
validation of existing grid models.

    <title>An Object Detecting Signal Analysis Method Based on General
  Approximation Entropy and Wavelet De-noising</title>
    <summary>  The construction quality of the bolt is directly related to the safety of the
project. The construction quality of the bolt anchorage must be tested. In this
paper, the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (ICEEMD)
method is introduced into the bolt detection signal analysis. The ICEEMD is
used to decompose the anchor detection signal according to the approximate
entropy of each intrinsic mode function (IMF). The noise of the IMFs is
eliminated by the wavelet soft threshold de-noising technique. Based on the
approximate entropy and the wavelet de-noising principle, the ICEEMD-De anchor
signal analysis method is proposed. From the analysis of the vibration analog
signal, as well as the bolt detection signal, the result shows that the
ICEEMD-De method is able to correctly separate the different IMFs under the
noisy condition, and the IMF can effectively identify the reflection signal of
the end of the bolt.

    <title>Heterogeneous Networked Data Recovery from Compressive Measurements
  Using a Copula Prior</title>
    <summary>  Large-scale data collection by means of wireless sensor network and
internet-of-things technology poses various challenges in view of the
limitations in transmission, computation, and energy resources of the
associated wireless devices. Compressive data gathering based on compressed
sensing has been proven a well-suited solution to the problem. Existing designs
exploit the spatiotemporal correlations among data collected by a specific
sensing modality. However, many applications, such as environmental monitoring,
involve collecting heterogeneous data that are intrinsically correlated. In
this study, we propose to leverage the correlation from multiple heterogeneous
signals when recovering the data from compressive measurements. To this end, we
propose a novel recovery algorithm---built upon belief-propagation
principles---that leverages correlated information from multiple heterogeneous
signals. To efficiently capture the statistical dependencies among diverse
sensor data, the proposed algorithm uses the statistical model of copula
functions. Experiments with heterogeneous air-pollution sensor measurements
show that the proposed design provides significant performance improvements
against state-of-the-art compressive data gathering and recovery schemes that
use classical compressed sensing, compressed sensing with side information, and
distributed compressed sensing.

    <title>Reliability assessment of microgrid with renewable generation and
  prioritized loads</title>
    <summary>  With the increase in awareness about the climate change, there has been a
tremendous shift towards utilizing renewable energy sources (RES). In this
regard, smart grid technologies have been presented to facilitate higher
penetration of RES. Microgrids are the key components of the smart grids.
Microgrids allow integration of various distributed energy resources (DER) such
as the distributed generation (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) into the
distribution system and hence remove or delay the need for distribution
expansion. One of the crucial requirements for utilities is to ensure that the
system reliability is maintained with the inclusion of microgrid topology.
Therefore, this paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containing
prioritized loads and distributed RES through a hybrid analytical-simulation
method. The stochasticity of RES introduces complexity to the reliability
evaluation. The method takes into account the variability of RES through Monte-
Carlo state sampling simulation. The results indicate the reliability
enhancement of the overall system in the presence of the microgrid topology. In
particular, the highest priority load has the largest improvement in the
reliability indices. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to
understand the effects of the failure of microgrid islanding in the case of a
fault in the upstream network.

    <title>Magnet-less Circulators Based on Spatio-temporal Modulation of Bandstop
  Filters in a Delta Topology</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we discuss the design rationale and guidelines to build
magnet-less circulators based on spatio-temporal modulation of resonant
junctions consisting of first-order bandstop filters connected in a delta
topology. Without modulation, the junction does not allow transmission between
its ports, however, when the natural oscillation frequencies of the constituent
LC filters are modulated in time with a suitable phase pattern, a synthetic
angular-momentum bias can be effectively imparted to the junction and a
transmission window opens at one of the output ports, thus realizing a
circulator. We develop a rigorous small-signal linear model and find analytical
expressions for the harmonic S-parameters of the proposed circuit, which
significantly facilitate the design process. We validate the theory with
simulations and further discuss the large signal response, including power
handling and non-linearity, and the noise performance. Finally, we present
measured results with unprecedented performance in all metrics for a PCB
prototype using a Rogers board and off-the-shelf discrete components.

    <title>Compressed Air Energy Storage-Part I: An Accurate Bi-linear Cavern Model</title>
    <summary>  Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is suitable for large-scale energy
storage and can help to increase the penetration of wind power in power
systems. A CAES plant consists of compressors, expanders, caverns, and a
motor/generator set. Currently used cavern models for CAES are either accurate
but highly non-linear or linear but inaccurate. Highly non-linear cavern models
cannot be directly utilized in power system optimization problems. In this
regard, an accurate bi-linear cavern model for CAES is proposed in this first
paper of a two-part series. The charging and discharging processes in a cavern
are divided into several virtual states and then the first law of
thermodynamics and ideal gas law are used to derive a cavern model, i.e., model
for the variation of temperature and pressure in these processes. Thereafter,
the heat transfer between the air in the cavern and the cavern wall is
considered and integrated into the cavern model. By subsequently eliminating
several negligible terms, the cavern model reduces to a bi-linear (linear)
model for CAES with multiple (single) time steps. The accuracy of the proposed
cavern model is verified via comparison with an accurate non-linear model.

    <title>Compressive Sensing by Shortest-Solution Guided Decimation</title>
    <summary>  Compressed sensing, which reconstructs a signal by finding sparse solutions
to underdetermined linear systems, is an important problem in many fields of
science and engineering. In this work we propose a deterministic and
non-parametric algorithm, Shortest-Solution guided Decimation (SSD), to
construct support of the sparse solution in an iterative way guided by the
shortest Euclidean-length solution of the recursively decimated linear equation
under orthogonal projections. The most significant feature of SSD is its
insensitivity to correlations in the sampling matrix. Using extensive numerical
experiments we show that SSD greatly outperforms L1-based methods, Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit, and Approximate Message Passing when the sampling matrix
contains strong correlations. This nice property of correlation tolerance makes
SSD a versatile and robust tool for different types of real-world signal
acquisition tasks.

    <title>Simple Signal Extension Method for Discrete Wavelet Transform</title>
    <summary>  Discrete wavelet transform of finite-length signals must necessarily handle
the signal boundaries. The state-of-the-art approaches treat such boundaries in
a complicated and inflexible way, using special prolog or epilog phases. This
holds true in particular for images decomposed into a number of scales,
exemplary in JPEG 2000 coding system. In this paper, the state-of-the-art
approaches are extended to perform the treatment using a compact streaming
core, possibly in multi-scale fashion. We present the core focused on CDF 5/3
wavelet and the symmetric border extension method, both employed in the JPEG
2000. As a result of our work, every input sample is visited only once, while
the results are produced immediately, i.e. without buffering.

    <title>Two asymptotic approaches for the exponential signal and harmonic noise
  in Singular Spectrum Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The general theoretical approach to the asymptotic extraction of the signal
series from the perturbed signal with the help of Singular Spectrum Analysis
(briefly, SSA) was already outlined in Nekrutkin 2010, SII, v. 3, 297--319.
  In this paper we consider the example of such an analysis applied to the
increasing exponential signal and the sinusoidal noise. It is proved that if
the signal rapidly tends to infinity, then the so-called reconstruction errors
of SSA do not uniformly tend to zero as the series length tends to infinity.
More precisely, in this case any finite number of last terms of the error
series do not tend to any finite or infinite values.
  On the contrary, for the "discretization" scheme with the bounded from above
exponential signal, all elements of the error series tend to zero.
  This effect shows that the discretization model can be an effective tool in
the theoretical SSA considerations with increasing signals.

    <title>Asymptotic robustness of Kelly's GLRT and Adaptive Matched Filter
  detector under model misspecification</title>
    <summary>  A fundamental assumption underling any Hypothesis Testing (HT) problem is
that the available data follow the parametric model assumed to derive the test
statistic. Nevertheless, a perfect match between the true and the assumed data
models cannot be achieved in many practical applications. In all these cases,
it is advisable to use a robust decision test, i.e. a test whose statistic
preserves (at least asymptotically) the same probability density function (pdf)
for a suitable set of possible input data models under the null hypothesis.
Building upon the seminal work of Kent (1982), in this paper we investigate the
impact of the model mismatch in a recurring HT problem in radar signal
processing applications: testing the mean of a set of Complex Elliptically
Symmetric (CES) distributed random vectors under a possible misspecified,
Gaussian data model. In particular, by using this general misspecified
framework, a new look to two popular detectors, the Kelly's Generalized
Likelihood Ration Test (GLRT) and the Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF), is
provided and their robustness properties investigated.

    <title>Achievable Information Rates for Fiber Optics: Applications and
  Computations</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, achievable information rates (AIR) for fiber optical
communications are discussed. It is shown that AIRs such as the mutual
information and generalized mutual information are good design metrics for
coded optical systems. The theoretical predictions of AIRs are compared to the
performance of modern codes including low-parity density check (LDPC) and polar
codes. Two different computation methods for these AIRs are also discussed:
Monte-Carlo integration and Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Closed-form ready-to-use
approximations for such computations are provided for arbitrary constellations
and the multidimensional AWGN channel. The computation of AIRs in optical
experiments and simulations is also discussed.

    <title>Analysis and Design of Cost-Effective, High-Throughput LDPC Decoders</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces a new approach to cost-effective, high-throughput
hardware designs for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoders. The proposed
approach, called Non-Surjective Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders (NS-FAIDs),
exploits the robustness of message-passing LDPC decoders to inaccuracies in the
calculation of exchanged messages, and it is shown to provide a unified
framework for several designs previously proposed in the literature. NS-FAIDs
are optimized by density evolution for regular and irregular LDPC codes, and
are shown to provide different trade-offs between hardware complexity and
decoding performance. Two hardware architectures targeting high-throughput
applications are also proposed, integrating both Min-Sum (MS) and NS-FAID
decoding kernels. ASIC post synthesis implementation results on 65nm CMOS
technology show that NS-FAIDs yield significant improvements in the throughput
to area ratio, by up to 58.75% with respect to the MS decoder, with even better
or only slightly degraded error correction performance.

    <title>Frequency offset tolerant synchronization signal design in NB-IoT</title>
    <summary>  Timing detection is the first step and very important in wireless
communication systems. Timing detection performance is usually affected by the
frequency offset. Therefore, it is a challenge to design the synchronization
signal in massive narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) scenarios where the
frequency offset is usually large due to the low cost requirement. In this
paper, we firstly proposed a new general synchronization signal structure with
a couple of sequences which are conjugated to remove the potential timing error
arose from large frequency offset. Then, we analyze the suitable sequence for
our proposed synchronization signal structure and discuss a special ZC sequence
as an example. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate our proposed
synchronization signal can work well when the frequency offset is large. It
means that our proposed synchronization signal design is very suitable for the
massive NB-IoT.

    <title>BER Performance of Uplink Massive MIMO With Low-Resolution ADCs</title>
    <summary>  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for
next generation wireless communication systems (5G). In this technology, Base
Station (BS) is equipped with a large number of antennas. Employing high
resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for all antennas may cause high
costs and high power consumption for the BS. By performing numerical results,
we evaluate the use of low-resolution ADCs for uplink massive MIMO by analyzing
Bit Error Rate (BER) performance for different detection techniques (MMSE, ZF)
and different modulations (QPSK, 16-QAM) to find an optimal quantization
resolution. Our results reveal that the BER performance of uplink massive MIMO
systems with a few-bit resolution ADCs is comparable to the case of having full
precision ADCs. We found that the optimum choice of quantization level (number
of bits in ADCs) depends on the modulation technique and the number of antennas
at the BS.

    <title>Beam Switching Techniques for Millimeter Wave Vehicle to Infrastructure
  Communications</title>
    <summary>  Beam alignment for millimeter wave (mm Wave) vehicular communications is
challenging due to the high mobility of vehicles. Recent studies have proposed
some beam switching techniques at Road Side Unit (RSU) for vehicle to
infrastructure (V2I) communications, employing initial position and speed
information of vehicles, that are sent through Dedicated Short Range
Communications (DSRC) to the RSU. However, inaccuracies of the provided
information lead to beam misalignment. Some beam design parameters are
suggested in the literature to combat this effect. But how these parameters
should be tuned? Here, we evaluate the effect of all these parameters, and
propose a beam design efficiency metric to perform beam alignment in the
presence of the estimation errors, and to improve the performance by choosing
the right design parameters.

    <title>Performance analysis of FSO using relays and spatial diversity under
  log-normal fading channel</title>
    <summary>  The performance analysis of free space optical communication (FSO) systems
using relays and spatial diversity at the source is studied in this paper. The
effect of atmospheric turbulence and attenuation has also been considered
caused by different weather conditions and geometric losses. The exact closed
form expressions are presented for bit-error rate (BER) for M-ary quadrature
amplitude modulation (M-QAM) for different types of FSO systems under
log-normal channel model. The performance of the link of FSO system is compared
for different system as on-off keying, M-ary pulse amplitude modulation.
Results shows that M-QAM outperforms other systems with same spectral
efficiency for each system with the help of relays.

    <title>A simple and fast frequency domain analysis method for calculating the
  frequency response and linearity of electro-optic microring modulators</title>
    <summary>  A fast and simple frequency domain method is introduced for the analysis of
microring modulator response using the Jacobi Anger expansion method. Resonance
frequency modulated microring (FMMR) modulators and coupling modulated
microring modulators (CMMR) are analyzed using this method. The linearity of
these modulators is analyzed. The third order intercept point (IP3) is
calculated for CMMR devices and compared to Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI)
modulator devices. It is shown that CMMR devices can achieve a 12dB higher IP3
compared to MZI devices. CMMR devices have high second order nonlinearity,
while MZI devices second order nonlinearity is zero. A novel geometry based on
dual CMMR modulators is introduced to improve the second order nonlinearity of
CMMR modulators.

    <title>Optimal Resource Allocation in Ultra-low Power Fog-computing SWIPT-based
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we consider a fog computing system consisting of a
multi-antenna access point (AP), an ultra-low power (ULP) single antenna device
and a fog server. The ULP device is assumed to be capable of both energy
harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) using a time-switching
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) scheme. The ULP
device deploys the harvested energy for ID and either local computing or
offloading the computations to the fog server depending on which strategy is
most energy efficient. In this scenario, we optimize the time slots devoted to
EH, ID and local computation as well as the time slot and power required for
the offloading to minimize the energy cost of the ULP device. Numerical results
are provided to study the effectiveness of the optimized fog computing system
and the relevant challenges.

    <title>GPR signal de-noise method based on variational mode decomposition</title>
    <summary>  Compared with traditional empirical mode decomposition (EMD) methods,
variational mode decomposition (VMD) has strong theoretical foundation and high
operational efficiency. The VMD method is introduced to ground penetrating
radar (GPR) signal processing. The characteristics of GPR signals validate the
method of signal de-noising based on the VMD principle. The validity and
accuracy of the method are further verified via Ricker wavelet and forward
model GPR de-noising experiments. The method of VMD is evaluated in comparison
with traditional wavelet transform (WT) and EEMD (ensemble EMD) methods. The
method is subsequently used to analyze a GPR signal from a practical
engineering case. The results show that the method can effectively remove the
noise in the GPR data, and can obtain high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) even
under strong background noise.

    <title>Dynamic Uplink/Downlink Resource Management in Flexible Duplex-Enabled
  Wireless Networks</title>
    <summary>  Flexible duplex is proposed to adapt to the channel and traffic asymmetry for
future wireless networks. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms within
the flexible duplex framework for joint uplink and downlink resource allocation
in multi-cell scenario, named SAFP and RMDI, based on the awareness of
interference coupling among wireless links. Numerical results show significant
performance gain over the baseline system with fixed uplink/downlink resource
configuration, and over the dynamic TDD scheme that independently adapts the
configuration to time-varying traffic volume in each cell. The proposed
algorithms achieve two-fold increase when compared with the baseline scheme,
measured by the worst-case quality of service satisfaction level, under a low
level of traffic asymmetry. The gain is more significant when the traffic is
highly asymmetric, as it achieves three-fold increase.

    <title>Improving Resource Efficiency with Partial Resource Muting for Future
  Wireless Networks</title>
    <summary>  We propose novel resource allocation algorithms that have the objective of
finding a good tradeoff between resource reuse and interference avoidance in
wireless networks. To this end, we first study properties of functions that
relate the resource budget available to network elements to the optimal utility
and to the optimal resource efficiency obtained by solving max-min utility
optimization problems. From the asymptotic behavior of these functions, we
obtain a transition point that indicates whether a network is operating in an
efficient noise-limited regime or in an inefficient interference-limited regime
for a given resource budget. For networks operating in the inefficient regime,
we propose a novel partial resource muting scheme to improve the efficiency of
the resource utilization. The framework is very general. It can be applied not
only to the downlink of 4G networks, but also to 5G networks equipped with
flexible duplex mechanisms. Numerical results show significant performance
gains of the proposed scheme compared to the solution to the max-min utility
optimization problem with full frequency reuse.

    <title>A Novel Mataheuristic based Interference Alignment for K-User
  Interference Channel : A Comparative Study</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a new Interference Alignment (IA) scheme for K-User
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Interference Channel (IC) based on two
metaheuristics, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee
Colony (ABC) Algorithm. Tackling interference is an essential issue in wireless
communications to which Interference Alignment (IA) provides a promising
solution. However, IA still lacks of explicit and straightforward design
procedures. In fact, most of IA procedures aim to minimize a certain
Interference Leakage (IL) which measures the effect of the interference on the
network, this results in complex optimization tasks involving a large amount of
decision variables, together with a problem of convergence of the IA solutions.
In this paper the IA optimization is performed using PSO, ABC and their
cooperative counterparts, more suitable for large scale optimization. A
comparison between the four algorithms is also carried out. The cooperative
proposed approaches seem to be promising.

    <title>Photonic machine learning implementation for signal recovery in optical
  communications</title>
    <summary>  Nonlinearities put strict limitations on communication speed and distance in
fibre-optic transmission systems. We show that some limitations can be overcome
when converting the standard direct detection process into a pattern
recognition problem. Machine learning techniques have proven efficient in
pattern recognition tasks. However, they have not yet been exploited in optical
communication systems for fast data recovery due to slow algorithmic
processing. Here we propose photonic implementations of machine learning for
binary data classification. We demonstrate experimentally their capability to
improve data recovery of signals that suffer from severe nonlinear distortion
after extended fibre transmission. The achieved improvement reaches up to two
orders of magnitude in bit-error-rate compared to directly classifying the
transmission output. This offers an increase in transmission length over 75%.
While not yet offering real-time post-processing at telecom rates, we show how
appropriate designs of the photonic reservoir can greatly reduce the speed
penalty.

    <title>Cell Detection by Functional Inverse Diffusion and Group Sparsity $-$
  Part I: Theory</title>
    <summary>  In this two-part paper, we present a novel framework and methodology to
analyze data from certain image-based biochemical assays, e.g., ELISPOT and
Fluorospot assays. In this first part, we start by presenting a physical PDE
model up to image acquisition for these biochemical assays. Then, we use the
model's Green function to derive a novel parametrization of the image
measurements. This parametrization allows us to propose a group-sparsity
regularized functional optimization problem to address the inversion of the
model, i.e., the localization and characterization of the biological cells
involved in the assay. Finally, we derive the results necessary to establish
the iterations and convergence of an Accelerated Proximal Gradient algorithm
(FISTA) to address this inverse problem.

    <title>Eigenspace-Based Minimum Variance Adaptive Beamformer Combined with
  Delay Multiply and Sum: Experimental Study</title>
    <summary>  Delay and sum (DAS) is the most common beamforming algorithm in linear-array
photoacoustic imaging (PAI) as a result of its simple implementation. However,
it leads to a low resolution and high sidelobes. Delay multiply and sum (DMAS)
was used to address the incapabilities of DAS, providing a higher image
quality. However, the resolution improvement is not well enough compared to
eigenspace-based minimum variance (EIBMV). In this paper, the EIBMV beamformer
has been combined with DMAS algebra, called EIBMV-DMAS, using the expansion of
DMAS algorithm. The proposed method is used as the reconstruction algorithm in
linear-array PAI. EIBMV-DMAS is experimentally evaluated where the quantitative
and qualitative results show that it outperforms DAS, DMAS and EIBMV. The
proposed method degrades the sidelobes for about 365 %, 221 % and 40 %,
compared to DAS, DMAS and EIBMV, respectively. Moreover, EIBMV-DMAS improves
the SNR about 158 %, 63 % and 20 %, respectively.

    <title>Stall Pattern Avoidance in Polynomial Product Codes</title>
    <summary>  Product codes are a concatenated error-correction scheme that has been often
considered for applications requiring very low bit-error rates, which demand
that the error floor be decreased as much as possible. In this work, we
consider product codes constructed from polynomial algebraic codes, and propose
a novel low-complexity post-processing technique that is able to improve the
error-correction performance by orders of magnitude. We provide lower bounds
for the error rate achievable under post processing, and present simulation
results indicating that these bounds are tight.

    <title>An order optimal policy for exploiting idle spectrum in cognitive radio
  networks</title>
    <summary>  In this paper a spectrum sensing policy employing recency-based exploration
is proposed for cognitive radio networks. We formulate the problem of finding a
spectrum sensing policy for multi-band dynamic spectrum access as a stochastic
restless multi-armed bandit problem with stationary unknown reward
distributions. In cognitive radio networks the multi-armed bandit problem
arises when deciding where in the radio spectrum to look for idle frequencies
that could be efficiently exploited for data transmission. We consider two
models for the dynamics of the frequency bands: 1) the independent model where
the state of the band evolves randomly independently from the past and 2) the
Gilbert-Elliot model, where the states evolve according to a 2-state Markov
chain. It is shown that in these conditions the proposed sensing policy attains
asymptotically logarithmic weak regret. The policy proposed in this paper is an
index policy, in which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample
mean term and a recency-based exploration bonus term. The sample mean promotes
spectrum exploitation whereas the exploration bonus encourages for further
exploration for idle bands providing high data rates. The proposed recency
based approach readily allows constructing the exploration bonus such that it
will grow the time interval between consecutive sensing time instants of a
suboptimal band exponentially, which then leads to logarithmically increasing
weak regret. Simulation results confirming logarithmic weak regret are
presented and it is found that the proposed policy provides often improved
performance at low complexity over other state-of-the-art policies in the
literature.

    <title>Photoacoustic Imaging using Combination of Eigenspace-Based Minimum
  Variance and Delay-Multiply-and-Sum Beamformers: Simulation Study</title>
    <summary>  Delay and Sum (DAS), as the most common beamforming algorithm in
Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI), having a simple implementation, results in a
low-quality image. Delay Multiply and Sum (DMAS) was introduced to improve the
quality of the reconstructed images using DAS. However, the resolution
improvement is now well enough compared to high resolution adaptive
reconstruction methods such as Eigenspace- Based Minimum Variance (EIBMV). We
proposed to integrate the EIBMV inside the DMAS formula by replacing the
existing DAS algebra inside the expansion of DMAS, called EIBMV-DMAS. It is
shown that EIBMV-DMAS outperforms DMAS in the terms of levels of sidelobes and
width of mainlobe significantly. For instance, at the depth of 35 mm,
EIBMV-DMAS outperforms DMAS and EIBMV in the term of sidelobes for about 108
dB, 98 dB and 44 dB compared to DAS, DMAS, and EIBMV, respectively. The
quantitative comparison has been conducted using Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM)
and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and it was shown that EIBMV-DMAS reduces the
FWHM about 1.65 mm and improves the SNR about 15 dB, compared to DMAS.

    <title>Interconnection Strategies for Self-Calibration of Large Scale Antenna
  Arrays</title>
    <summary>  In time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) relies on the channel reciprocity to obtain the downlink
(DL) channel state information (CSI) with the uplink (UL) CSI. In practice, the
mismatches in the radio frequency (RF) analog circuits among different antennas
at the base station (BS) break the end-to-end UL and DL channel reciprocity.
Antenna calibration is necessary to avoid the severe performance degradation
with massive MIMO. Many calibration schemes are available to compensate the RF
gain mismatches and restore the channel reciprocity in TDD massive MIMO
systems. In this paper, we focus on the internal self-calibration scheme where
different BS antennas are interconnected via hardware transmission lines.
First, we study the resulting calibration performance for an arbitrary
interconnection strategy. Next, we obtain closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) expressions for each interconnection strategy at the BS with only (M-1)
transmission lines and M denotes the total number of BS antennas. Basing on the
derived results, we further prove that the star interconnection strategy is
optimal for internal self-calibration due to its lowest CRLB. In addition, we
also put forward efficient recursive algorithms to derive the corresponding
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of all the calibration coefficients.
Numerical simulation results are also included to corroborate our theoretical
analyses and results.

    <title>Spectral and Energy Efficiency of Superimposed Pilots in Uplink Massive
  MIMO</title>
    <summary>  Next generation wireless networks aim at providing substantial improvements
in spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Massive MIMO has been
proved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially
multiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential
limitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which
arises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by
reusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot
contamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot
sequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative
method, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data
symbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot
contamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using
maximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE.
To this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a
practical random BS deployment. We prove that the reduction of pilot
contamination with SP is outweighed by the additional coherent and non-coherent
interference. Numerical results show that when both methods are optimized, RP
achieves comparable SE and EE to SP in practical scenarios.

    <title>Linear Array Photoacoustic Imaging Using Minimum Variance-Based Delay
  Multiply and Sum Adaptive Beamforming Algorithm</title>
    <summary>  In Photoacoustic imaging (PA), Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer is a common
beamforming algorithm having a simple implementation. However, it results in a
poor resolution and high levels of sidelobe. To address these challenges, a new
algorithm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) was introduced having lower
sidelobes compared to DAS. Improving the resolution of DMAS, a novel beamformer
is introduced using Minimum Variance (MV) adaptive beamforming combined with
DMAS, so-called Minimum Variance-Based DMAS (MVB-DMAS). It is shown that
expanding the DMAS equation results in multiple terms representing a DAS
algebra. It is proposed to use the MV adaptive beamformer instead of the
existing DAS inside the DMAS algebra expansion. MVB-DMAS is evaluated
numerically and experimentally. It is shown that MVB-DMAS outperforms DAS, DMAS
and MV in terms of the resolution and sidelobes. In particular, at the depth of
45 mm MVB-DMAS results in about 31 dB, 18 dB and 8 dB levels of sidelobe
reduction compared to DAS, MV and DMAS, respectively. The quantitative results
show that MVB-DMAS leads to improvement in full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) about
95% compared to DMAS, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast ratio (CR)
enhancement, compared to MV, about 12% and 20%, respectively.

    <title>Pseudo-Linear-Time-Invariant Magnet-less Circulators Based on
  Differential Spatio-Temporal Modulation of Resonant Junctions</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present voltage- and current-mode differential magnet-less
non-reciprocal devices obtained by pairing two single-ended (SE) circulators,
each consisting of three first-order bandpass or bandstop LC filters, connected
in either a wye or a delta topology. The resonant poles of each SE circulator
are modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting in
synthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatio-temporal modulation
(STM). We tailor the two SE circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phase
difference between their STM biases. Unlike conventional differential
time-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, we
show that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (IM)
products, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits
for an external observer. In turn, this property enhances all metrics of the
resulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of SE architectures, and
improving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. We
show that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes the
required modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude. We develop a
rigorous small-signal model to guide the design of the proposed circuits and to
get insights into their pseudo-LTI characteristics. Then, we validate the
theory with simulations and measurements showing remarkable performance
compared to the current state of the art of magnet-less non-reciprocal devices.

    <title>Compressed Air Energy Storage-Part II: Application to Power System Unit
  Commitment</title>
    <summary>  Unit commitment (UC) is one of the most important power system operation
problems. To integrate higher penetration of wind power into power systems,
more compressed air energy storage (CAES) plants are being built. Existing
cavern models for the CAES used in power system optimization problems are not
accurate, which may lead to infeasible solutions, e.g., the air pressure in the
cavern is outside its operating range. In this regard, an accurate CAES model
is proposed for the UC problem based on the accurate bi-linear cavern model
proposed in the first paper of this two-part series. The minimum switch time
between the charging and discharging processes of CAES is considered. The whole
model, i.e., the UC model with an accurate CAES model, is a large-scale mixed
integer bi-linear programming problem. To reduce the complexity of the whole
model, three strategies are proposed to reduce the number of bi-linear terms
without sacrificing accuracy. McCormick relaxation and piecewise linearization
are then used to linearize the whole model. To decrease the solution time, a
method to obtain an initial solution of the linearized model is proposed. A
modified RTS-79 system is used to verify the effectiveness of the whole model
and the solution methodology.

    <title>Massive MIMO 1-Bit DAC Transmission: A Low-Complexity Symbol Scaling
  Approach</title>
    <summary>  We study the multi-user massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems
and focus on the downlink transmission, where the base station (BS) employs a
large antenna array with low-cost 1-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). It
is observed that the direct combination of existing beamforming schemes with
1-bit DACs will lead to an error floor at medium-to-high SNR regime, due to the
coarse quantization of the DACs with limited precision. In this paper, based on
the concept of constructive interference we consider both a quantized linear
beamforming scheme where we analytically obtain the optimal beamforming matrix,
and a non-linear mapping scheme where we directly design the transmit signal
vector. Due to the 1-bit quantization, the formulated optimization for the
non-linear mapping scheme is shown to be non-convex. To solve this problem, the
non-convex constraints of 1-bit DACs are firstly relaxed, followed by an
element-wise normalization to satisfy the 1-bit DAC transmission. We further
propose a low-complexity symbol scaling scheme that consists of three stages,
in which the quantized transmit signal on each antenna element is selected
sequentially. Numerical results show that the proposed symbol scaling scheme
achieves a comparable performance to the optimization-based non-linear mapping
approach, while its corresponding complexity is negligible compared to that of
the non-linear scheme.

    <title>Biosignal Analysis with Matching-Pursuit Based Adaptive Chirplet
  Transform</title>
    <summary>  Chirping phenomena, in which the instantaneous frequencies of a signal change
with time, are abundant in signals related to biological systems. Biosignals
are non-stationary in nature and the time-frequency analysis is a viable tool
to analyze them. It is well understood that Gaussian chirplet function is
critical in describing chirp signals. Despite the theory of adaptive chirplet
transform (ACT) has been established for more than two decades and is well
accepted in the community of signal processing, application of ACT to
bio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because that
the power of ACT, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet been
fully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. In
this paper, we describe a novel ACT algorithm based on the "coarse-refinement"
scheme. Namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with the
matching-pursuit (MP) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we coin as MPEM algorithm. We
emphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, which
is important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strong
background noise. We then demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by
applying it to the analysis of representative biosignals, including visual
evoked potentials (bioelectrical signals), audible heart sounds and bat
ultrasonic echolocation signals (bioacoustic signals), and human speech. The
results show that the MPEM algorithm provides more compact representation of
signals under investigation and clearer visualization of their time-frequency
structures, indicating considerable promise of ACT in biosignal analysis. The
MATLAB code repository is hosted on GitHub for free download

    <title>Compressive Sensing Based Signal Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks:
  A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Compressive sensing (CS) has been shown to be promising in a wide variety of
applications including compressive imaging, video processing, communication,
and radar to name a few. Out of the many potential applications, in this survey
paper, our goal is to discuss recent advances of CS based signal processing in
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) including the main ongoing/recent research
efforts, challenges and research trends in this area. In a WSN, CS based
techniques are well motivated by not only the sparsity prior but also by the
requirement of energy efficient processing even with nonsparse signals. First,
we address different forms of sparsity including temporal and spatial that are
exhibited in WSNs. We discuss sparsity aware signal processing techniques
exploiting such forms of sparsity in centralized as well as
distributed/decentralized settings from signal reconstruction perspective. We
then review recent research efforts that exploit CS to solve different types of
inference problems such as detection, classification, and estimation where
signal reconstruction is not necessary. We further review the work that takes
practical considerations such as quantization, physical layer secrecy
constraints, and imperfect channel conditions into account in the CS based
signal processing framework. Finally, open research issues and challenges are
discussed in order to provide perspectives for future research directions. With
this paper, the readers are expected to gain a thorough understanding of the
potential of CS in solving distributed inference problems in WSNs with high
dimensional data under practical constraints.

    <title>Sub-Nyquist Sampling for Joint Wideband Spectrum Sensing and
  Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we study the problem of joint wideband spectrum sensing and
direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in a sub-Nyquist sampling framework.
Specifically, considering a scenario where a few uncorrelated narrowband
signals spread over a wide (say, several GHz) frequency band, our objective is
to estimate the carrier frequencies and the DoAs associated with the narrowband
sources, as well as reconstruct the power spectra of these narrowband signals.
To overcome the sampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, we
propose a new phased-array based sub-Nyquist sampling architecture with
variable time delays, where a uniform linear array (ULA) is employed and the
received signal at each antenna is delayed by a variable factor and then
sampled by a synchronized low-rate analog-digital converter (ADC). Based on the
collected sub-Nyquist samples, we calculate a set of cross-correlation matrices
with different time lags, and develop a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition-based method for joint DoA, carrier frequency and power spectrum
recovery. Perfect recovery conditions for the associated parameters and the
power spectrum are analyzed. Simulation results show that our proposed method
can reliably perform the wideband spectrum sensing with a sampling rate far
below the Nyquist rate, and achieves an estimation accuracy close to the
associated Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) using only a small number of data
samples.

    <title>Performance Analysis of Coherent and Noncoherent Modulation under I/Q
  Imbalance</title>
    <summary>  In-phase/quadrature-phase Imbalance (IQI) is considered a major
performance-limiting impairment in direct-conversion transceivers. Its effects
become even more pronounced at higher carrier frequencies such as the
millimeter-wave frequency bands being considered for 5G systems. In this paper,
we quantify the effects of IQI on the performance of different modulation
schemes under multipath fading channels. This is realized by developing a
general framework for the symbol error rate (SER) analysis of coherent phase
shift keying, noncoherent differential phase shift keying and noncoherent
frequency shift keying under IQI effects. In this context, the moment
generating function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is first
derived for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems suffering from
transmitter (TX) IQI only, receiver (RX) IQI only and joint TX/RX IQI.
Capitalizing on this, we derive analytic expressions for the SER of the
different modulation schemes. These expressions are corroborated by comparisons
with corresponding results from computer simulations and they provide insights
into the dependence of IQI on the system parameters. We demonstrate that the
effects of IQI differ considerably depending on the considered system as some
cases of single-carrier transmission appear robust to IQI, whereas
multi-carrier systems experiencing IQI at the RX require compensation in order
to achieve a reliable communication link.

    <title>Proactive Doppler Shift Compensation in Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
    <summary>  In vehicular cyber-physical systems (CPS), safety information, including
vehicular speed and location information, is shared among vehicles via wireless
waves at specific frequency. This helps control vehicle to alleviate traffic
congestion and road accidents. However, Doppler shift existing between vehicles
with high relative speed causes an apparent frequency shift for the received
wireless wave, which consequently decreases the reliability of the recovered
safety information and jeopardizes the safety of vehicular CPS. Passive
confrontation of Doppler shift at the receiver side is not applicable due to
multiple Doppler shifts at each receiver. In this paper, we provide a proactive
Doppler shift compensation algorithm based on the probabilistic graphical
model. Each vehicle pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that
there is no frequency shift from the desired carrier frequency between each
pair of transceiver. The pre-compensated offset for each vehicle is computed in
a distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed and dynamic
topology of vehicular CPS. Besides, the updating procedure is designed in a
broadcasting fashion to reduce communication burden. It is rigorously proved
that the proposed algorithm is convergence guaranteed even for systems with
packet drops and random communication delays. Simulations based on real map and
transportation data verify the accuracy and convergence property of the
proposed algorithm. It is shown that this method achieves almost the optimal
frequency compensation accuracy with an error approaching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao
lower bound.

    <title>The Impact of Transceiver Noise on Digital Nonlinearity Compensation</title>
    <summary>  The efficiency of digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC) is analyzed in the
presence of noise arising from amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE) as
well as from a non-ideal transceiver subsystem. Its impact on signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and reach increase is studied with particular emphasis on split
NLC, where the digital back-propagation algorithm is divided between
transmitter and receiver. An analytical model is presented to compute the SNR's
for non-ideal transmission systems with arbitrary split NLC configurations.
When signal-signal nonlinearities are compensated, the performance limitation
arises from residual signal-noise interactions. These interactions consist of
nonlinear beating between the signal and co-propagating ASE and transceiver
noise. While transceiver noise-signal beating is usually dominant for short
transmission distances, ASE noise-signal beating is dominant for larger
transmission distances. It is shown that both regimes behave differently with
respect to the optimal NLC split ratio and their respective reach gains.
Additionally, simple formulas for the prediction of the optimal NLC split ratio
and the reach increase in those two regimes are reported. It is found that
split NLC offers negligible gain with respect to conventional digital
back-propagation (DBP) for distances less than 1000 km using standard
single-mode fibers and a transceiver (back-to-back) SNR of 26 dB, when
transmitter and receiver inject the same amount of noise. However, when
transmitter and receiver inject an unequal amount of noise, reach gains of 56%
on top of DBP are achievable by properly tailoring the split NLC algorithm. The
theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations.

    <title>Cache Placement in Fog-RANs: From Centralized to Distributed Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  To deal with the rapid growth of high-speed and/or ultra-low latency data
traffic for massive mobile users, fog radio access networks (Fog-RANs) have
emerged as a promising architecture for next-generation wireless networks. In
Fog-RANs, the edge nodes and user terminals possess storage, computation and
communication functionalities to various degrees, which provides high
flexibility for network operation, i.e., from fully centralized to fully
distributed operation. In this paper, we study the cache placement problem in
Fog-RANs, by taking into account flexible physical-layer transmission schemes
and diverse content preferences of different users. We develop both centralized
and distributed transmission aware cache placement strategies to minimize
users' average download delay subject to the storage capacity constraints. In
the centralized mode, the cache placement problem is transformed into a matroid
constrained submodular maximization problem, and an approximation algorithm is
proposed to find a solution within a constant factor to the optimum. In the
distributed mode, a belief propagation based distributed algorithm is proposed
to provide a suboptimal solution, with iterative updates at each BS based on
locally collected information. Simulation results show that by exploiting
caching and cooperation gains, the proposed transmission aware caching
algorithms can greatly reduce the users' average download delay.

    <title>User-centric C-RAN Architecture for Ultra-dense 5G Networks: Challenges
  and Methodologies</title>
    <summary>  Ultra-dense networks (UDN) constitute one of the most promising techniques of
supporting the 5G mobile system. By deploying more small cells in a fixed area,
the average distance between users and access points can be significantly
reduced, hence a dense spatial frequency reuse can be exploited. However,
severe interference is the major obstacle in UDN. Most of the contributions
deal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This paper
advocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDN, thanks
to the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN,
centralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission.
We summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs. One of the most
challenging issues is the requirement of the global CSI for the sake of
cooperative transmission. We investigate this requirement by only relying on
partial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the
estimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot
allocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising
research directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with
special emphasis on the application of the `big data' techniques.

    <title>Lung sound classification using local binary pattern</title>
    <summary>  Lung sounds contain vital information about pulmonary pathology. In this
paper, we use short-term spectral characteristics of lung sounds to recognize
associated diseases. Motivated by the success of auditory perception based
techniques in speech signal classification, we represent time-frequency
information of lung sounds using mel-scale warped spectral coefficients, called
here as mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs). Next, we employ local
binary pattern analysis (LBP) to capture texture information of the MFSCs, and
the feature vectors are subsequently derived using histogram representation.
The proposed features are used with three well-known classifiers in this field:
k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector
machine (SVM). Also, the performance was tested with multiple SVM kernels. We
conduct extensive performance evaluation experiments using two databases which
include normal and adventitious sounds. Results show that the proposed features
with SVM and also with kNN classifier outperform commonly used wavelet-based
features as well as our previously investigated mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) based statistical features, specifically in abnormal sound
detection. Proposed features also yield better results than morphological
features and energy features computed from rational dilation wavelet
coefficients. The Bhattacharyya kernel performs considerably better than other
kernels. Further, we optimize the configuration of the proposed feature
extraction algorithm. Finally, we have applied mRMR (minimum-redundancy
maximum-relevancy) based feature selection method to remove redundancy in the
feature vector which makes the proposed method computationally more efficient
without any degradation in the performance. The overall performance gain is up
to 24.5% as compared to the standard wavelet feature based system.

    <title>Adaptive Nonlinear RF Cancellation for Improved Isolation in
  Simultaneous Transmit-Receive Systems</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes an active radio frequency (RF) cancellation solution to
suppress the transmitter (TX) passband leakage signal in radio transceivers
supporting simultaneous transmission and reception. The proposed technique is
based on creating an opposite-phase baseband equivalent replica of the TX
leakage signal in the transceiver digital front-end through adaptive nonlinear
filtering of the known transmit data, to facilitate highly accurate
cancellation under a nonlinear TX power amplifier (PA). The active RF
cancellation is then accomplished by employing an auxiliary transmitter chain,
to generate the actual RF cancellation signal, and combining it with the
received signal at the receiver (RX) low noise amplifier (LNA) input. A
closed-loop parameter learning approach, based on the decorrelation principle,
is also developed to efficiently estimate the coefficients of the nonlinear
cancellation filter in the presence of a nonlinear TX PA with memory, finite
passive isolation, and a nonlinear RX LNA. The performance of the proposed
cancellation technique is evaluated through comprehensive RF measurements
adopting commercial LTE-Advanced transceiver hardware components. The results
show that the proposed technique can provide an additional suppression of up to
54 dB for the TX passband leakage signal at the RX LNA input, even at
considerably high transmit power levels and with wide transmission bandwidths.
Such novel cancellation solution can therefore substantially improve the TX-RX
isolation, hence reducing the requirements on passive isolation and RF
component linearity, as well as increasing the efficiency and flexibility of
the RF spectrum use in the emerging 5G radio networks.

    <title>Performance Bounds for Parameter Estimation under Misspecified Models:
  Fundamental findings and applications</title>
    <summary>  Inferring information from a set of acquired data is the main objective of
any signal processing (SP) method. In particular, the common problem of
estimating the value of a vector of parameters from a set of noisy measurements
is at the core of a plethora of scientific and technological advances in the
last decades; for example, wireless communications, radar and sonar,
biomedicine, image processing, and seismology, just to name a few. Developing
an estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the
measured data, i.e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct,
fully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements.
Experience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any
assumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present.
Consequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the
estimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be
mismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance
loss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model
misspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further,
understanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model
misspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and
practical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of
this paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on
estimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model
misspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical
literature in the last fifty years. Secondly, some applications are discussed
to illustrate the broad range of areas and problems to which this framework
extends, and consequently the numerous opportunities available for SP
researchers.

    <title>Shannon information storage in fringe-patterns and fringe-data
  compression by phase-shifting algorithms</title>
    <summary>  Standard optical phase-metrology fringe-patterns are digitized with XxY
pixels and 8 bits/pixel (or higher) gray-levels. The digitized 8 bits/pixel are
raw-data bits, not Shannon information bits. Here we show that noisy digital
fringe-patterns store much lower amount of Shannon information than the
capacity of the digitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) cameras may waste to noise most bits/pixel. On the other hand, one would
hardly use smartphone cameras for quality phase-metrology, because of their
lower (S/N) images. However smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel)
images. In communications theory, the standard formalism for measuring
information are the Shannon-entropy H, and Shannon capacity theorem (SCT).
According to SCT, low (S/N) may be compensated with large fringe-bandwidth to
obtain high-precision phase measurements. So large bandwidth fringes may be
used for quality phase-measurements, in spite of low (S/N). Most natural video
images are highly redundant because they usually have large smooth zones where
the pixel-value do not change much. So data compression algorithms for image
and video transmission and storage are paramount. Shannon's capacity is used to
gauge competing compression algorithms. We also use Kolmogorov's entropy
theorem, to show that a sequence of phase-shifted fringes, store low amounts of
information because they are highly correlated. We also show that
phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) may be regarded as efficient fringe-data
compression algorithms. Therefore a large number of phase-shifted fringes may
be packed into a single complex-valued image. This is very important in
spaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by
huge distance and low-power radio transmission.

    <title>Support Spinor Machine</title>
    <summary>  We generalize a support vector machine to a support spinor machine by using
the mathematical structure of wedge product over vector machine in order to
extend field from vector field to spinor field. The separated hyperplane is
extended to Kolmogorov space in time series data which allow us to extend a
structure of support vector machine to a support tensor machine and a support
tensor machine moduli space. Our performance test on support spinor machine is
done over one class classification of end point in physiology state of time
series data after empirical mode analysis and compared with support vector
machine test. We implement algorithm of support spinor machine by using
Holo-Hilbert amplitude modulation for fully nonlinear and nonstationary time

    <title>Estimate Exchange over Network is Good for Distributed Hard Thresholding
  Pursuit</title>
    <summary>  We investigate an existing distributed algorithm for learning sparse signals
or data over networks. The algorithm is iterative and exchanges intermediate
estimates of a sparse signal over a network. This learning strategy using
exchange of intermediate estimates over the network requires a limited
communication overhead for information transmission. Our objective in this
article is to show that the strategy is good for learning in spite of limited
communication. In pursuit of this objective, we first provide a restricted
isometry property (RIP)-based theoretical analysis on convergence of the
iterative algorithm. Then, using simulations, we show that the algorithm
provides competitive performance in learning sparse signals vis-a-vis an
existing alternate distributed algorithm. The alternate distributed algorithm
exchanges more information including observations and system parameters.

    <title>Cloud-aided collaborative estimation by ADMM-RLS algorithms for
  connected vehicle prognostics</title>
    <summary>  As the connectivity of consumer devices is rapidly growing and cloud
computing technologies are becoming more widespread, cloud-aided techniques for
parameter estimation can be designed to exploit the theoretically unlimited
storage memory and computational power of the cloud, while relying on
information provided by multiple sources. With the ultimate goal of developing
monitoring and diagnostic strategies, this report focuses on the design of a
Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) based estimator for identification over a group
of devices connected to the cloud. The proposed approach, that relies on
Node-to-Cloud-to-Node (N2C2N) transmissions, is designed so that: (i) estimates
of the unknown parameters are computed locally and (ii) the local estimates are
refined on the cloud. The proposed approach requires minimal changes to local
(pre-existing) RLS estimators.

    <title>A Centralized Power Control and Management Method for Grid-Connected
  Photovoltaic (PV)-Battery Systems</title>
    <summary>  Distributed Generation (DG) is an effective way of integrating renewable
energy sources to conventional power grid, which improves the reliability and
efficiency of power systems. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are ideal DGs thanks to
their attractive benefits, such as availability of solar energy and low
installation costs. Battery groups are used in PV systems to balance the power
flows and eliminate power fluctuations due to change of operating condition,
e.g., irradiance and temperature variation. In an attempt to effectively manage
the power flows, this paper presents a novel power control and management
system for grid-connected PV-Battery systems. The proposed system realizes the
maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV panels, stabilization of the DC
bus voltage for load plug-and-play access, balance among the power flows, and
quick response of both active and reactive power demands.

    <title>Enhanced Linear-array Photoacoustic Beamforming using Modified Coherence
  Factor</title>
    <summary>  Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising medical imaging modality providing
the spatial resolution of ultrasound (US) imaging and the contrast of pure
optical imaging. For linear-array PAI, a beamformer has to be used as the
reconstruction algorithm. Delay-and-sum (DAS) is the most prevalent beamforming
algorithm in PAI. However, using DAS beamformer leads to low resolution images
along with significant effects of the off-axis signals. Coherence factor (CF)
is a weighting method in which each pixel of the reconstructed image is
weighted, based on the spatial spectrum of the aperture, to improve the
contrast. In this paper, it has been shown that the numerator of the formula of
CF contains a DAS algebra, and it was proposed to use the
delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) beamformer instead of the available DAS on the
numerator. The proposed weighting technique, modified CF (MCF), has been
evaluated numerically and experimentally compared to CF, and it was shown that
MCF leads to lower sidelobes and better detectable targets. The quantitative
results of the experiment show that MCF leads to for about 45% and 40%
improvement, in comparison with CF, in the terms of signal-to-noise ratio and
full-width-half-maximum, respectively.

    <title>Finite Time Identification in Unstable Linear Systems</title>
    <summary>  Identification of the parameters of stable linear dynamical systems is a
well-studied problem in the literature, both in the low and high-dimensional
settings. However, there are hardly any results for the unstable case,
especially regarding finite time bounds. For this setting, classical results on
least-squares estimation of the dynamics parameters are not applicable and
therefore new concepts and technical approaches need to be developed to address
the issue. Unstable linear systems reflect key real applications in control
theory, econometrics, and finance.
  This study establishes finite time bounds for the identification error of the
least-squares estimates for a fairly large class of heavy-tailed noise
distributions, and transition matrices of such systems. The results relate the
time length required as a function of the problem dimension and key
characteristics of the true underlying transition matrix and the noise
distribution. To obtain them, appropriate concentration inequalities for random
matrices and for sequences of martingale differences are leveraged.

    <title>Covert Single-hop Communication in a Wireless Network with Distributed
  Artificial Noise Generation</title>
    <summary>  Covert communication, also known as low probability of detection (LPD)
communication, prevents the adversary from knowing that a communication is
taking place. Recent work has demonstrated that, in a three-party scenario with
a transmitter (Alice), intended recipient (Bob), and adversary (Warden Willie),
the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted reliably from Alice to Bob
without detection by Willie, when additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels
exist between all parties, is on the order of the square root of the number of
channel uses. In this paper, we begin consideration of network scenarios by
studying the case where there are additional "friendly" nodes present in the
environment that can produce artificial noise to aid in hiding the
communication. We establish achievability results by considering constructions
where the system node closest to the warden produces artificial noise and
demonstrate a significant improvement in the throughput achieved covertly,
without requiring close coordination between Alice and the noise-generating
node. Conversely, under mild restrictions on the communication strategy, we
demonstrate no higher covert throughput is possible. Extensions to the
consideration of the achievable covert throughput when multiple wardens
randomly located in the environment collaborate to attempt detection of the
transmitter are also considered.

    <title>Blind Detection of Polar Codes</title>
    <summary>  Polar codes were recently chosen to protect the control channel information
in the next-generation mobile communication standard (5G) defined by the 3GPP.
As a result, receivers will have to implement blind detection of polar coded
frames in order to keep complexity, latency, and power consumption tractable.
As a newly proposed class of block codes, the problem of polar-code blind
detection has received very little attention. In this work, we propose a
low-complexity blind-detection algorithm for polar-encoded frames. We base this
algorithm on a novel detection metric with update rules that leverage the a
priori knowledge of the frozen-bit locations, exploiting the inherent
structures that these locations impose on a polar-encoded block of data. We
show that the proposed detection metric allows to clearly distinguish
polar-encoded frames from other types of data by considering the cumulative
distribution functions of the detection metric, and the receiver operating
characteristic. The presented results are tailored to the 5G standardization
effort discussions, i.e., we consider a short low-rate polar code concatenated
with a CRC.

    <title>Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Speech Enhancement and
  Noise-Robust Speaker Verification</title>
    <summary>  Improving speech system performance in noisy environments remains a
challenging task, and speech enhancement (SE) is one of the effective
techniques to solve the problem. Motivated by the promising results of
generative adversarial networks (GANs) in a variety of image processing tasks,
we explore the potential of conditional GANs (cGANs) for SE, and in particular,
we make use of the image processing framework proposed by Isola et al. [1] to
learn a mapping from the spectrogram of noisy speech to an enhanced
counterpart. The SE cGAN consists of two networks, trained in an adversarial
manner: a generator that tries to enhance the input noisy spectrogram, and a
discriminator that tries to distinguish between enhanced spectrograms provided
by the generator and clean ones from the database using the noisy spectrogram
as a condition. We evaluate the performance of the cGAN method in terms of
perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI), and equal error rate (EER) of speaker verification (an
example application). Experimental results show that the cGAN method overall
outperforms the classical short-time spectral amplitude minimum mean square
error (STSA-MMSE) SE algorithm, and is comparable to a deep neural
network-based SE approach (DNN-SE).

    <title>Covert Wireless Communication with Artificial Noise Generation</title>
    <summary>  Covert communication conceals the transmission of the message from an
attentive adversary. Recent work on the limits of covert communication in
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels has demonstrated that a covert
transmitter (Alice) can reliably transmit a maximum of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$ bits to a covert receiver (Bob) without
being detected by an adversary (Warden Willie) in $n$ channel uses. This paper
focuses on the scenario where other friendly nodes distributed according to a
two-dimensional Poisson point process with density $m$ are present in the
environment. We propose a strategy where the friendly node closest to the
adversary, without close coordination with Alice, produces artificial noise. We
show that this method allows Alice to reliably and covertly send
$\mathcal{O}(\min\{{n,m^{\gamma/2}\sqrt{n}}\})$ bits to Bob in $n$ channel
uses, where $\gamma$ is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, we also consider a
setting where there are $N_{\mathrm{w}}$ collaborating adversaries uniformly
and randomly located in the environment and show that in $n$ channel uses,
Alice can reliably and covertly send
$\mathcal{O}\left(\min\left\{n,\frac{m^{\gamma/2}
\sqrt{n}}{N_{\mathrm{w}}^{\gamma}}\right\}\right)$ bits to Bob when $\gamma
&gt;2$, and $\mathcal{O}\left(\min\left\{n,\frac{m
\sqrt{n}}{N_{\mathrm{w}}^{2}\log^2 {N_{\mathrm{w}}}}\right\}\right)$ when
$\gamma = 2$. Conversely, under mild restrictions on the communication
strategy, we demonstrate that no higher covert throughput is possible for
$\gamma&gt;2$.

    <title>Modeling Transmission and Radiation Effects when Exploiting Power Line
  Networks for Communication</title>
    <summary>  Power distribution grids are exploited by Power Line Communication (PLC)
technology to convey high frequency data signals. The natural conformation of
such power line networks causes a relevant part of the high frequency signals
traveling through them to be radiated instead of being conducted. This causes
not only electromagnetic interference (EMI) with devices positioned next to
power line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity.
Since existing PLC channel models do not take into account losses due to
radiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accurate
network simulators. A thorough analysis is herein presented about the conducted
and radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode to
common mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. The outcome of this
work allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmission
matrix. Furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit of
transmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. The
results of this paper lay the foundations for future developments of
comprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiated
phenomena.

    <title>Microcomb-based true-time-delay network for microwave beamforming</title>
    <summary>  Microwave phased array antennas (PAAs) are very attractive to defense
applications and high-speed wireless communications for their abilities of fast
beam scanning and complex beam pattern control. However, traditional PAAs based
on phase shifters suffer from the beam-squint problem and have limited
bandwidths. True-time-delay (TTD) beamforming based on low-loss photonic delay
lines can solve this problem. But it is still quite challenging to build
large-scale photonic TTD beamformers due to their high hardware complexity. In
this paper, we demonstrate a photonic TTD beamforming network based on a
miniature microresonator frequency comb (microcomb) source and dispersive time
delay. We show that microcombs can be promising candidate for TTD beamforming
due to their compact volume and wide spectra. The experimentally demonstrated
TTD beamforming network can support a PAA with 21 elements. The microwave
frequency range is 8~20 GHz; and the beam scanning range is +/- 60.2 degree.
Limited by the available components in our laboratory, a real antenna array was
not constructed; however, detailed measurements of the microwave amplitudes and
phases were performed that allow us to simulate the beamforming performance
that could be obtained with a real array. The scheme can potentially support
larger PAAs with hundreds of elements by increasing the number of comb lines
with broadband microcomb generation. Arbitrary beam pattern control is also
possible by incorporating optical spectral shaping. Gaussian, rectangular
beamforming, and beam notch control are evaluated.
