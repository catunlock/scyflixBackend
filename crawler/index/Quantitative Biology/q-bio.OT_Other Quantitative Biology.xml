    <title>Genetic Code as a Harmonic System: two Supplements</title>
    <summary>  The paper represents two supplements to the source paper, q-bio.OT/0610044,
with two new series of harmonic structures of the genetic code, determined by
Gauss arithmetical algorithm through atom number balances. By this the
determination itself appears as a connection between Gauss algorithm and
polarity of molecules (about polarity: in Suppl. 2).

    <title>G-quadruplexes and mRNA localization</title>
    <summary>  G-quadruplexes represent a novelty for molecular biology. Their role inside
the cell remains mysterious. We investigate a possible correlation with mRNA
localization. In particular, we hypothesize that Gquadruplexes influence fluid

    <summary>  Point mutations can surely be dangerous but what is worst than to lose the
reading frame?! Does DNA evolved a strategy to try to limit frameshift
mutations?! Here we investigate if DNA sequences effectively evolved a system
to minimize frameshift mutations analyzing the transcripts of proteins with
high molecular weights.

    <title>No crisis should go to waste</title>
    <summary>  The crisis in the reproducibility of experiments invites a re-evaluation of
methods of inquiry and validation procedures. The text challenges current
assumptions of knowledge acquisition and introduces G-complexity for defining
decidable vs. non-decidable knowledge domains. A "second Cartesian revolution"
should result in scientific methods that transcend determinism and
reductionism.

    <summary>  We have proposed the neck linker swing model to investigate the mechanism of
mechanochemical coupling of kinesin. The Michaelis-Menten-like curve for
velocity vs ATP concentration at different loads has been obtained, which is in
agreement with experiments. We have predicted that Michaelis constant doesn't
increase monotonically and an elastic instability will happen with increasing
of applied force.

    <title>A model for exploring bird morphology</title>
    <summary>  A simplified model of the bird skeleton along with elongation parameters for
the flight feathers is used to explore the diversity of bird shapes. Varying a
small number of parameters simulates a wide range of observed bird silhouettes.
The model may serve to examine developmental factors involved, help museum
curators develop computational approaches to bird morphometry and has
applications in computer generated illustration.

    <title>Sparse Approximation of Computational Time Reversal Imaging</title>
    <summary>  Computational time reversal imaging can be used to locate the position of
multiple scatterers in a known background medium. Here, we discuss a sparse
approximation method for computational time-reversal imaging. The method is
formulated entirely in the frequency domain, and besides imaging it can also be
used for denoising, and to determine the magnitude of the scattering
coefficients in the presence of moderate noise levels.

    <summary>  We present a completely new version of our arithmetic model of the standard
genetic code and compute in a straightforward manner the exact numeric
degeneracies of the five multiplets without any trick for the doublets and the
sextets, as we have done previously. We give also some interesting
applications.

    <title>Reasons underlying certain tendencies in the data on the frequency of
  codon usage</title>
    <summary>  The tendencies described in this work were revealed in the course of
examination of adenine and uracil distribution in the mRNA encoding sequence.
The study also discusses the usage of codons occupied by the amino acid
arginine in the table of the universal genetic code. All of the described
tendencies are qualitative, so neither sophisticated methods nor cumbersome
calculations are necessary to reveal and interpret them.

    <title>Insights Into Quantitative Biology: analysis of cellular adaptation</title>
    <summary>  In the last years many powerful techniques have emerged to measure protein
interactions as well as gene expression. Many progresses have been done since
the introduction of these techniques but not toward quantitative analysis of
data. In this paper we show how to study cellular adaptation and how to detect
cellular subpopulations. Moreover we go deeper in analyzing signal transduction
pathways dynamics.

    <title>Genetic proof of chromatin diminution under mitotic agamospermy</title>
    <summary>  The previously published data are examined on the base of the hypothesis
about existence of differential polyteny of chromosomes and excess chromatin
diminution during the first stages of embryogenesis. It has been concluded that
available data provide the genetic proof that chromatin diminution is one of
the mechanisms underlying the origin of polymorphism in sugar beet
agamospermous progenies.

    <title>Success of Chemotherapy in Soft Matter</title>
    <summary>  The success of chemotharapy in soft matter as a survival is found in the
paper. Therefore, it is found the analogous tumor stretching force in soft
matter; ultrasonography is performed for this tumor; restoration in soft matter
with such a tumor is found; Bayes estimate of the probability of chemotherapy
success is derived from the transferred chemical energy and from soft matter
entropy; survival probability is juxtaposed to this probability of success.

    <summary>  Nurses social well-being deserves special attention. Effective well-being
promotion strategies should be executed for promoting their social well-being
particularly in areas of social integration and social acceptance. Moreover,
nurses, particularly female nurses, need strong financial, emotional,

    <title>The role of Junk DNA</title>
    <summary>  Many efforts have been done in order to explain the role of junk DNA, but its
function remain to be elucidated. In addition the GC-content variations among
species still represent an enigma. Both these two misteries can have a common
explanation: we hypothesize that the role of junk DNA is to preserve the
mutations probability that is intrinsically reduced in GC-poorest genomes.

trasversions, so on the basis of the molecule, or in terms of GC-content and
isochors, through the quantification of GC-&gt;AT mutations over AT-&gt;GC mutations.
We tried a different approach hypothesizing that probably we are partially
protected (by the genetic code) from amyloid fibrils formation.

    <title>Contiguity is limited in free recall</title>
    <summary>  Does the "law of contiguity" apply to free recall? I find that conditional
response probabilities, often used as evidence for contiguity in free recall,
have been displayed insufficiently, limiting the distance from the last item
recalled, and only averaged over all items. When fully expanding the x-axis and
examining the conditional response probabilities separately for the beginning,
middle and end of the presented item list, I show that the law of contiguity
applies only locally, even then only sometimes, and breaks down globally.

    <title>Large individual differences in free recall</title>
    <summary>  Using single factor ANOVA I show that there are large individual differences
in free recall ({\eta} ranges from 0.09-0.26) including the total recall, the
balance between recency and primacy, and the initial recall (subsequent recalls
show smaller individual differences). All three memory properties are
relatively uncorrelated. The variance in the initial position may be a measure
of executive control and is correlated with total recall (the smaller the
variation, the larger the recall).

    <title>Direct Evidence Delay with A Task Decreases Working Memory Content in
  Free Recall</title>
    <summary>  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty the working memory and a second stage concludes the recall
(Tarnow, 2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974).
It is commonly believed that a delay with a task before the recall starts
removes the content of working memory (Glanzer &amp; Cunitz, 1966). Here is
presented the first direct evidence that this is indeed the case.

    <title>Autoantibody recognition mechanisms of MUC1</title>
    <summary>  The most cost-effective blood-based, noninvasive molecular cancer biomarkers
are based on p53 epitopes and MUC1 tandem repeats. Here we use dimensionally
compressed bioinformatic fractal scaling analysis to compare the two distinct
and comparable probes, which examine different sections of the autoantibody
population, achieving combined sensitivities of order 50%. We discover a
promising MUC1 epitope in the SEA region outside the tandem repeats.

    <summary>  To be cost-effective, biomedical proteins must be optimized with regard to
many factors. Road maps are customary for large-scale projects, and here
descriptive methods based on bioinformatic fractal thermodynamic scales are
tested against an important example, HPV vaccine. Older scales from before 2000
are found to yield inconclusive results, but modern bioinformatic scales are
amazingly accurate, with a high level of internal consistency, and little
ambiguity.

    <title>Why are we not able to see beyond three dimensions?</title>
    <summary>  This is perhaps a philosophical question rather than a mathematical one, we
do not expect to give a full answer, even though we hope to clarify some ideas.
In addition, we would like to provide a new perspective on the subject. We will
find curious analogies with the way we perceive color and make some imaginary
experiments showing that, even living imprisoned in three dimensions it could
be different.

    <title>Emergence of Function</title>
    <summary>  This work gives a mathematical study of tissue dynamics. We combine
within-cell genome dynamics and diffusion between cells, where the synthesis of
the two gives rise to the emergence of function. We introduce a concept of
monotonicity and prove that monotonicity together with hardwiring, defined as
all cells of the same tissue having the same genome dynamics, is sufficient for
the global convergence of the tissue dynamics.

    <summary>  In the present article we demonstrate a new hybrid model of tumor growth. Our
model is stochastic by tumor population development and strongly deterministic
in cell motility dynamics and spatial propagation. In addition, it has
excellent extendibility property. Described model is tested on general behavior
and on avascular tumor growth case qualitatively.

    <title>Why humans die -- an unsolved biological problem</title>
    <summary>  Mortality is an instrument of natural selection. Evolutionary motivated
theories imply its irreversibility and life history dependence. This is
inconsistent with mortality data for protected populations. Accurate analysis
yields mortality law, which is specific for their evolutionary unprecedented
conditions, yet universal for species as evolutionary remote as humans and
flies. The law is exact, instantaneous, reversible, stepwise, and allows for a
rapid (within less than two years for humans) and significant mortality
decrease at any (but very old) age.

    <title>Results and Limitations of the Soliton Theory of DNA Transcription</title>
    <summary>  It has been suggested by several authors that nonlinear excitations, in
particular solitary waves, could play a fundamental functional role in the
process of DNA transcription, effecting the opening of the double chain needed
for RNA Polymerase to be able to copy the genetic code. Some models have been
proposed to model the relevant DNA dynamics in terms of a reduced number of
effective degrees of freedom. Here I discuss advantages and disadvantages of
such an approach, and discuss in more detail one of the models, i.e. the one
proposed by Yakushevich.

    <title>Correction algorithm for finite sample statistics</title>
    <summary>  Assume in a sample of size M one finds M_i representatives of species i with
i=1...N^*. The normalized frequency p^*_i=M_i/M, based on the finite sample,
may deviate considerably from the true probabilities p_i. We propose a method
to infer rank-ordered true probabilities r_i from measured frequencies M_i. We
show that the rank-ordered probabilities provide important informations on the
system, e.g., the true number of species, the Shannon- and the Renyi-entropies.

    <title>Vaccination pattern affects immunological response</title>
    <summary>  The response of the immune system to different vaccination patterns is
studied with a simple model. It is argued that the history and characteristics
of the pattern defines very different secondary immune responses in the case of
infection. The memory function of the immune response can be set to work in
very different modes depending on the pattern followed during immunizations. It
is argued that the history and pattern of immunizations can be a decisive (and
experimentally accessible) factor to tailor the effectiveness of a specific
vaccine.

    <title>Robust formation of morphogen gradients</title>
    <summary>  We discuss the formation of graded morphogen profiles in a cell layer by
nonlinear transport phenomena, important for patterning developing organisms.
We focus on a process termed transcytosis, where morphogen transport results
from binding of ligands to receptors on the cell surface, incorporation into
the cell and subsequent externalization. Starting from a microscopic model, we
derive effective transport equations. We show that, in contrast to morphogen
transport by extracellular diffusion, transcytosis leads to robust ligand
profiles which are insensitive to the rate of ligand production.

    <title>On the discrete Peyrard-Bishop model of DNA: stationary solutions and
  stability</title>
    <summary>  As a first step in the search of an analytical study of mechanical
denaturation of DNA in terms of the sequence, we study stable, stationary
solutions in the discrete, finite and homogeneous Peyrard-Bishop DNA model. We
find and classify all the stationary solutions of the model, as well as
analytic approximations of them, both in the continuum and in the discrete
limits. Our results explain the structure of the solutions reported by
Theodorakopoulos {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 258101 (2004)] and
provide a way to proceed to the analysis of the generalized version of the
model incorporating the genetic information.

    <summary>  The effects of pure multiplicative noise on stochastic resonance in an
anti-tumor system modulated by a seasonal external field are investigated by
using theoretical analyses of the generalized potential and numerical
simulations. For optimally selected values of the multiplicative noise
intensity quasi-symmetry of two potential minima and stochastic resonance are
observed. Theoretical results and numerical simulations are in good
quantitative agreement.

    <title>Perceptions of Complex Systems Are Governed by Power Laws</title>
    <summary>  Many networks in natural and human-made systems exhibit scale-free properties
and are small worlds. Now we show that people's understanding of complex
systems in their cognitive maps also follow a scale-free topology. People focus
on a few attributes, relating these with many other things in the system. Many
more attributes have very few connections. People use relatively short
explanations to describe events; their cognitive map is a small world with less
than six degrees of separation. These findings may help us to better understand
people's perceptions, especially when it comes to decision-making, conflict
resolution, politics and management.

    <title>Quantum Effects and Genetics Code: Dynamics and Information Transfer in
  DNA Replication</title>
    <summary>  The possible role of quantum effects in transfer of genetic information is
studied. It's argued that the nucleotides selection during DNA replication is
performed by means of proton tunneling between nucleotide and DNA-polimerase
bound by hydrogen bonds. Such mechanism is sensitive to the structure of
nucleotide hydrogen bonds, consequently only one nucleotide sort is captured by
DNA-polimerase in each event.The algorithm of this multistep selection
mechanism is also analysed from the point of its optimality. It's shown that
it's equivalent to Grover algorithm of data base search.

    <title>Nucleotide Frequencies in Human Genome and Fibonacci Numbers</title>
    <summary>  This work presents a mathematical model that establishes an interesting
connection between nucleotide frequencies in human single-stranded DNA and the
famous Fibonacci's numbers. The model relies on two assumptions. First,
Chargaff's second parity rule should be valid, and, second, the nucleotide
frequencies should approach limit values when the number of bases is
sufficiently large. Under these two hypotheses, it is possible to predict the
human nucleotide frequencies with accuracy. It is noteworthy, that the
predicted values are solutions of an optimization problem, which is commonplace
in many nature's phenomena.

    <title>A number theoretical observation about the degeneracy of the genetic
  code</title>
    <summary>  We discuss the similarity of the degeneration structure of the genetic code
with a pure number theoretic -- ``divisors code.'' The most interesting thing
about our observation is not that there is a connection between number theory
and the genetic code, but the simplicity of the rule. We hope that the
observation and the naive model presented in this paper will serve for ideas to
other models of the degeneracy of the genetic code. Maybe, the ideas of this
article can also be used in the area of artificial life to syntesize artificial
genetic codes.

    <title>Short-time dynamics of polypeptides</title>
    <summary>  The authors study the short-time dynamics of helix-forming polypeptide chains
using an all-atom representation of the molecules and an implicit solvation
model to approximate the interaction with the surrounding solvent. The results
confirm earlier observations that the helix-coil transition in proteins can be
described by a set of critical exponents. The high statistics of the
simulations allows the authors to determine the exponents values with increased
precision and support universality of the helix-coil transition in homopolymers
and (helical) proteins.

    <title>Noise Correlation Induced Synchronization in a Mutualism Ecosystem</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the cause of the synchronization of population evolution is an
important issue for ecological improvement. Here we present a
Lotka-Volterra-type model driven by two correlated environmental noises and
show, via theoretical analysis and direct simulation, that noise correlation
can induce a synchronization of the mutualists. The time series of mutual
species exhibit a chaotic-like fluctuation, which is independent to the noise
correlation, however, the chaotic fluctuation of mutual species ratio decreases
with the noise correlation. A quantitative parameter defined for characterizing
chaotic fluctuation provides a good approach to measure when the complete
synchronization happens.

    <title>A quantum-theoretical approach to the phenomenon of directed mutations
  in bacteria</title>
    <summary>  The Darwinian paradigm of biological evolution is based on the separability
of the variation and selection processes. As a result, the population thinking
had always been an integral part of the Darwinian approach. I propose an
alternative scheme of biological adaptation. It is based on appreciation of
limits of what we can observe considering an individual biological object. This
leads to a possibility for the adaptation process to occur on the level of a
single object, as a 'selection among virtual states of the organism'. I discuss
the application of this idea to the phenomenon of adaptive mutations in
bacteria.

    <title>Topological coding in hippocampus</title>
    <summary>  The proposed analysis of the currently available experimental results
concerning the neural cell activity in the brain area known as hippocampus
suggests a particular mechanism of spatial information and memory processing.
Below it is argued that the spatial information available through the analysis
of the hippocampal cell activity is predominantly of topological nature. It is
pointed out that a direct topological analysis can produce a topological
invariant based classification of the cell activity patterns and a complete
topological description of animal's current environment. It also provides a
full first order logical system for local topological reasoning about spatial
structure and animal's navigational strategies.

    <title>Complexities of Human Promoter Sequences</title>
    <summary>  By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance
characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for
the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at
$\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left
and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are
asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths,
respectively.

dualism and Gompertzian dynamics of growth and self-organization" (BioSystems
82 (2005)61-73) is presented. It has been proved that the main idea of this
work that Gompertzian dynamics is governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation
including anharmonic Morse potential has been already introduced by Molski and
Konarski in 2003. Some inconsistencies and mathematical errors in the

    <title>On the Classification Scheme for Phenomenological Universalities in

    <summary>  Comment on "Classification Scheme for Phenomenological Universalities in
Growth Problems in Physics and Other Sciences" by P. Castorina, P. P. Delsanto
and C. Guiot, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 188701 (2006) is presented. It has
been proved that the West-like function of growth derived by the authors is
incorrect and the approach does not take into account the growth of the
biological systems undergoing atrophy or demographic and economic systems
undergoing involution or regression. A simple extension of the model, which
permits derivation of the so far unknown involuted Gompertz function of growth
is proposed.

    <title>Newton-type Methods for REML Estimation in Genetic Analysis of
  Quantitative Traits</title>
    <summary>  Robust and efficient optimization methods for variance component estimation
using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) models for genetic mapping of
quantitative traits are considered. We show that the standard Newton-AI scheme
may fail when the optimum is located at one of the constraint boundaries, and
we introduce different approaches to remedy this by taking the constraints into
account. We approximate the Hessian of the objective function using the average
information matrix and also by using an inverse BFGS formula. The robustness
and efficiency is evaluated for problems derived from two experimental data
from the same animal populations.

    <title>Spatiotemporal Noise Triggering Infiltrative Tumor Growth under Immune
  Surveillance</title>
    <summary>  A spatiotemporal noise is assumed to reflect the environmental fluctuation in
a spatially extended tumor system. We introduce firstly the structure factor to
reveal the invasive tumor growth quantitatively. The homogenous environment can
lead to an expansive growth of the tumor cells, while the inhomogenous
environment underlies an infiltrative growth. The different responses of above
two cases are separated by a characteristic critical intensity of the
spatiotemporal noise. Theoretical and numerical results present a close
annotation to the clinical images.

    <title>Within-host HIV models with periodic antiretroviral therapy</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates the effect of drug treatment on the standard
within-host HIV model, assuming that therapy occurs periodically. It is shown
that eradication is possible under these periodic regimes, and we
quantitatively characterize successful drugs or drug combinations, both
theoretically and numerically. We also consider certain optimization problems,
motivated for instance, by the fact that eradication should be achieved at
acceptable toxicity levels to the patient. It turns out that these optimization
problems can be simplified considerably, and this makes calculations of the
optima a fairly straightforward task. All our results will be illustrated by
means of numerical examples based on up-to-date knowledge of parameter values
in the model.

    <title>Reverse Engineering of Proteasomal Translocation Rates</title>
    <summary>  We address the problem of proteasomal protein translocation and introduce a
new stochastic model of the proteasomal digestion (cleavage) of proteins. In
this model we account for the protein translocation and the positioning of
cleavage sites of a proteasome from first principles. We show by test examples
and by processing experimental data that our model allows reconstruction of the
translocation and cleavage rates from mass spectroscopy data on digestion
patterns and can be used to investigate the properties of transport in
different experimental set-ups. Detailed investigation with this model will
enable theoretical quantitative prediction of the proteasomal activity.

    <title>The genetic code Via Godel encoding</title>
    <summary>  The genetic code structure into distinct multiplet-classes as well as the
numeric degeneracies of the latter are revealed by a two-step process. First,
an empirical inventory of the degeneracies (of the shuffled multiplets) in two
specific equal moieties of the experimental genetic code table is made and
transcribed in the form of a sequence of integers. Second, a Godel Encoding
procedure is applied to the latter sequence delivering, as an output, a Godel
Number the digits of which, from the decimal representation, could remarkably
describe the amino acids and the stops and allow us also to compute the exact
degeneracies, class by class. The standard and the vertebrate mitochondrial
genetic codes are considered and their multiplet structure is fully
established.

    <title>Prey-predator modeling of CO2 atmospheric concentration</title>
    <summary>  In this work we propose a mathematical model, based in a modified version of
the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator equations, to predict the increasing in CO2
atmospheric concentration. We consider how the photosynthesis rate has changed
with the increase of CO2 and how this affects plant reproduction and CO2
absorptions rates. Total CO2 emissions (natural and manmade) and biomass
numerical parameter changes are considered. It is shown that the atmospheric
system can be in equilibrium under some specific conditions, and also some
comparisons with historical are done.

    <title>Human-Robot Biodynamics</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents the scientific body of knowledge behind the Human
Biodynamics Engine (HBE), a human motion simulator developed on the concept of
Euclidean motion group SE(3), with 270 active degrees of freedom,
force-velocity-time muscular mechanics and two-level neural control -
formulated in the fashion of nonlinear humanoid robotics. The following aspects
of the HBE development are described: geometrical, dynamical, control,
physiological, AI, behavioral and complexity, together with several simulation
examples.

    <title>The genetic code degeneracy and the amino acids chemical composition are
  connected</title>
    <summary>  We show that our recently published Arithmetic Model of the genetic code
based on Godel Encoding is robust against symmetry transformations, specially
Rumer s one U &gt; G, A &gt; C, and constitutes a link between the degeneracy
structure and the chemical composition of the 20 canonical amino acids. As a
result, several remarkable atomic patterns involving hydrogen, carbon, nucleon
and atom numbers are derived. This study has no obvious practical
application(s) but could, we hope, add some new knowledge concerning the
physico-mathematical structrure of the genetic code.

    <title>Optimality Properties of a Proposed Precursor to the Genetic Code</title>
    <summary>  We calculate the optimality of a doublet precursor to the canonical genetic
code with respect to mitigating the effects of point mutations and compare our
results to corresponding ones for the canonical genetic code. We find that the
proposed precursor has much less optimality than that of the canonical code.
Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an
intermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These
findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary
dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical
significance, it arose before the emergence of translation.

    <title>Coherent and Noncoherent Photonic Communications in Biological Systems</title>
    <summary>  The possible mechanisms of communications between distant bio-systems by
means of optical and UV photons are studied. It is argued that their main
production mechanism is owed to the biochemical reactions, occurring during the
cell division.. In the proposed model the bio-systems perform such
communications, radiating the photons in form of short periodic bursts, which
were observed experimentally for fish and frog eggs1. For experimentally
measured photon rates the communication algorithm is supposedly similar to the
exchange of binary encoded data in computer net via optical channels

    <title>On (Schröedinger's) quest for new physics for life</title>
    <summary>  Two recent investigations are reviewed: quantum effects for DNA aggregates
and scars formation on virus capsids. The possibility that scars could explain
certain data recently obtained by Sundquist's group in electron cryotomography
of immature HIV-1 virions is also briefly addressed. Furthermore, a bottom-up
reflection is presented on the need to invent new physics to pave the way to a
rigorous physical theory of biological phenomena. Our experience in the two
researches presented here and our personal interpretation of Schroedinger's
vision are behind the latter request.

    <title>Genetic Code and Number Theory</title>
    <summary>  Living organisms are the most complex, interesting and significant objects
regarding all substructures of the universe. Life science is regarded as a
science of the 21st century and one can expect great new discoveries in the
near futures. This article contains an introductory brief review of genetic
information, its coding and translation of genes to proteins through the
genetic code. Some theoretical approaches to the modelling of the genetic code
are presented. In particular, connection of the genetic code with number theory
is considered and the role of $p$-adic numbers is underlined.

    <title>The genome is software and evolution is a software developer</title>
    <summary>  The genome is software because it a set of verbal instructions for a
programmable computer, the ribosome. The theory of evolution now reads:
evolution is the software developer responsible for the existence of the
genome. We claim that this setting, whose official name is genetic programming,
is necessary and sufficient to discuss all important questions about evolution.
A great effort has been made to pass from wording to science, i.e., from naive
theories to robust models to predictions to testing for falsification.

    <title>A heuristic view about the evolution and species</title>
    <summary>  The controversy concerning both the definition of the species and methods for
inferring the boundaries and numbers of species has occupied biologists for
centuries, and the debate itself has become known as the species problem. The
modern theory of evolution depends on a fundamental redefinition of "species".
Here we show that based on the model of evolutionary continuum combined with
fuzzy theory that the evolution system is a uncountable infinite set and
species is a fuzzy set, the contradiction between discrete biological entities
and continuous evolution system is solved, i.e. when a species evolved, the
individuals scattered in space but continuously distributed on time sequences.
Moreover, the calculation methods for species are suggested both in theory and
practice.

    <title>DNA waves and water</title>
    <summary>  Some bacterial and viral DNA sequences have been found to induce low
frequency electromagnetic waves in high aqueous dilutions. This phenomenon
appears to be triggered by the ambient electromagnetic background of very low
frequency. We discuss this phenomenon in the framework of quantum field theory.
A scheme able to account for the observations is proposed. The reported
phenomenon could allow to develop highly sensitive detection systems for
chronic bacterial and viral infections.

    <title>The multiplet structure of the genetic code, in one and small number</title>
    <summary>  In this short paper, it is shown that the multiplet structure of the standard
genetic code is derivable from the total number of nucleotides contained in 64
codons, 192, a small number. The degeneracy class-number is derived as the
number of numbers coprime to the number of Family-Boxes involved for the
quartets, the doublets and the singlets. Those for the triplet and the sextets
are computed as simple linear combinations of the preceeding ones. Some
interesting consequences are also presented.

    <title>Rate distortion coevolutionary dynamics and the flow nature of cognitive
  epigenetic systems</title>
    <summary>  We outline a model for a cognitive epigenetic system based on elements of the
Shannon theory of information and the statistical physics of the generalized
Onsager relations. Particular attention is paid to the concept of the rate
distortion function and from another direction as motivated by the
thermodynamics of computing, the fundamental homology with the free energy
density of a physical system. A unifying aspect of the dynamic framework
involves the concept of a groupoid and of a groupoid atlas. From a stochastic
differential equation we postulate a multidimensional Ito process for an
epigenetic system from which a stochastic flow may permeate through components
of this atlas.

    <title>What does photon energy tell us about cellphone safety?</title>
    <summary>  It has been argued that cellphones are safe because a single microwave photon
does not have enough energy to break a chemical bond. We show that cellphone
technology operates in the classical wave limit, not the single photon limit.
Based on energy densities relative to thermal energy, we estimate thresholds at
which effects might be expected. These seem to correspond somewhat with many
experimental observations.

    <title>Quantum theory of hydrogen key of point mutation in DNA</title>
    <summary>  Quantum theory of hydrogen atoms distribution between two complementary
nucleotide bases in DNA double helix at moment of replication has been proposed
in this work. It bases on two mechanisms of proton tunneling: the
Andreev-Meyerovich mechanism with spontaneous phonon radiation and the
Kagan-Maximov (Flynn-Stoneham) mechanism at phonon scattering. According to the
presented model, the probability of proton location in shallow potential well
(point mutation form) is directly proportional to temperature. It was shown
that the point mutation probability decreases with increasing replication
velocity.

    <title>A pulse fishery model with closures as function of the catch: Conditions
  for sustainability</title>
    <summary>  We present a model of single species fishery which alternates closed seasons
with pulse captures. The novelty is that the length of a closed season is
determined by the stock size of the last capture. The process is described by a
new type of impulsive differential equations recently introduced. The main
result is a fishing effort threshold which determines either the sustainability
of the fishery or the extinction of the resource.

    <title>Three-stage Origin of Life as a Result of Directional Darwinian
  Evolution</title>
    <summary>  The original hypothesis about Three-stage origin of life (TOL) on the Earth
is developed and discussed. The role of the temperature factor in life origin
is considered. It is supposed, that three stages of abiogenesis (DNA world, RNA
world and the Protein world) consistently followed each other during Darwinian
evolution. At the same time, the natural directional selection of the most
stable macromolecules and effective catalytic reactions took place. The
direction of this selection is related to action of the principle of
{\guillemotleft}Increasing Independence from the Environment{\guillemotright}
(IIE) and is caused by temperature evolution of the atmosphere of the Earth.
The direction of Anagenesis and inevitability of occurrence of genetic
mechanisms is discussed.

    <title>Photonic Communications and Information Encoding in Biological Systems</title>
    <summary>  The structure of optical radiation emitted by the samples of loach fish eggs
is studied. It was found earlier that such radiation perform the communications
between distant samples, which result in the synchronization of their
development. The photon radiation in form of short quasi-periodic bursts was
observed for fish and frog eggs, hence the communication mechanism can be
similar to the exchange of binary encoded data in the computer nets via the
noisy channels. The data analysis of fish egg radiation demonstrates that in
this case the information encoding is similar to the digit to time analogue
algorithm.

    <title>Exploration-exploitation trade-off features a saltatory search behaviour</title>
    <summary>  Searching experiments conducted in different virtual environments over a
gender balanced group of people revealed a gender irrelevant scale-free spread
of searching activity on large spatiotemporal scales. We have suggested and
solved analytically a simple statistical model of the coherent-noise type
describing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in humans ("should I stay or
should I go"). The model exhibits a variety of saltatory behaviours, ranging
from Levy flights occurring under uncertainty to Brownian walks performed by a
treasure hunter confident of the eventual success.

    <title>Translating photobiology to electrophysiology: A brief overview of
  several photobiological processes with accent on electrophysiology</title>
    <summary>  The mini-review gives special attention to holistic approach and mechanisms
of processes. The physical and chemical frames and background for visual
perception and signalling are discussed. Perception of photons by retinal rod
cells is described in more detail starting from photon absorption and
culminating in ion currents. Dark noise and temperature-dependence of
photoreceptor cells are analysed. Perception of polarised light, its effects
and informational importance are discussed based on underlying mechanisms and
specialised morphological structures of biological organisms. Role of
statistics of photons in photoreception is questioned. The review also
pinpoints new and developing directions and raises questions for the future
research.

    <title>The role of blood circulatory system in thermal regulation of animals
  explained by entropy production analysis</title>
    <summary>  A novel model of thermal regulation of homoeothermic animals has been
implemented. The model is based on a non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach
which introduces entropy balance and the rate of entropy generation as a
formulation of The Second Law. The model explains linear correlation between an
animals skin and environment temperatures using the first principles and
demonstrates the role of blood circulation in the thermoregulation of
homoeothermic animals.

    <title>Statistics of genome architecture</title>
    <summary>  The main statistical distributions applicable to the analysis of genome
architecture and genome tracks are briefly discussed and critically assessed.
Although the observed features in distributions of element lengths can be
equally well fitted by the different statistical approximations, the
interpretation of observed regularities may strongly depend on the chosen
scheme. We discuss the possible evolution scenarios and describe the main
characteristics obtained with different distributions. The expression for the
assessment of levels in hierarchical chromatin folding is derived and the
quantitative measure of genome architecture inhomogeneity is suggested. This
theory provides the ground for the regular statistical study of genome
architecture and genome tracks.

    <title>Time series analysis of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and

    <summary>  The aim of this paper is to study the (clinical) time-series data of three
diseases with complex dynamics: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For this purpose, first all of the time series
data are embedded in a vector space of suitable dimension and then the
correlation dimension of the above mentioned diseases is estimated. The results
are also compared with healthy control subjects. At the next step, existence of
chaos in these diseases is investigated by means of the so-called 0-1 test. The
simulations show that none of the above mentioned diseases are chaotic.

    <title>Pairwise alignment of the DNA sequence using hypercomplex number
  representation</title>
    <summary>  A new set of DNA base-nucleic acid codes and their hypercomplex number
representation have been introduced for taking the probability of each
nucleotide into full account. A new scoring system has been proposed to suit
the hypercomplex number representation of the DNA base-nucleic acid codes and
incorporated with the method of dot matrix analysis and various algorithms of
sequence alignment. The problem of DNA sequence alignment can be processed in a
rather similar way as pairwise alignment of protein sequence.

    <title>Synthetic biology: From a word to a world</title>
    <summary>  Synthetic biology is one of the battlefields where the main countries fight
for the supremacy in science. The word synthetic biology hides a big world,
ready to be explored by interdisciplinary research collaborations. The purpose
of this investigation is to reveal the what, where, when of the current
situation in this emerging field. A keyword search string for the field was
constructed and applied in the Web of Science and in the Derwent Innovations
Index. In particular, we calculated year based h-type indices for high-frequent
keywords.

    <title>An Integration of Integrated Information Theory with Fundamental Physics</title>
    <summary>  To truly eliminate Cartesian ghosts from the science of consciousness, we
must describe consciousness as an aspect of the physical. Integrated
Information Theory states that consciousness arises from intrinsic information
generated by dynamical systems; however existing formulations of this theory
are not applicable to standard models of fundamental physical entities. Modern
physics has shown that fields are fundamental entities, and in particular that
the electromagnetic field is fundamental. Here I hypothesize that consciousness
arises from information intrinsic to fundamental fields. This hypothesis unites
fundamental physics with what we know empirically about the neuroscience
underlying consciousness, and it bypasses the need to consider quantum effects.

    <title>DNA, Human Memory, and the Storage Technology of the 21st Century</title>
    <summary>  The sophisticated tools and techniques employed by Nature for purposeful
storage of information stand in stark contrast to the primitive and relatively
inefficient means used by man. We describe some impressive features of
biological data storage, and speculate on approaches to research and
development that could benefit the storage industry in the coming decades.

    <title>Towards life-long learning of posture control for s-EMG prostheses</title>
    <summary>  Surface electromyography (s-EMG) sensors are a promising way to control
upper-limb prostheses. However a training session is necessary in order to set
up the controller that will make s-EMG based movement possible. All data
recorded during the training session are used by a machine learning algorithm
to make a posture classification, that will allow the controller to distinguish
each posture. The aim of this study is to investigate if it's possible to make
a posture classification which can remain valid over time. The next step will
be the study of how it varies depending on the amount of information submitted
to it during the training session in view of real life everyday use of the
upper-limb prosthesis.

    <title>Understanding Functional Protein-Protein Interactions Of ABCB11 And ADA
  In Human And Mouse</title>
    <summary>  Proteins are macromolecules which hardly act alone; they need to make
interactions with some other proteins to do so. Numerous factors are there
which can regulate the interactions between proteins [4]. Here in this present
study we aim to understand Protein -Protein Interactions (PPIs) of two proteins
ABCB11 and ADA from quantitative point of view. One of our major aims also is
to study the factors that regulate the PPIs and thus to distinguish these PPIs
with proper quantification across the two species Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus
respectively to know how one protein interacts with different set of proteins
in different species.

    <title>Hidden Thermodynamic Information in Protein Amino Acid Mutation Tables</title>
    <summary>  We combine the standard 1992 20x20 substitution matrix based on block
alignment, BLOSUM62, with the standard 1982 amino acid hydropathicity scale KD
as well as the modern 2007 hydropathicity scale MZ, and compare the results.
The 20-parameter KD and MZ hydropathicity scales have different thermodynamic
character, corresponding to first and second order transitions. The KD and MZ
comparisons show that the mutation rates reflect quantitative iteration of
qualitative amino acid phobic and philic binary 2x10 properties that define
quaternary 4x5 subgroups (but not quinary 5x4 subgroups), with the modern MZ
bioinformatic scale giving much better results. The quaternary 5 mer MZ 4x5
subgroups are called mutons (Mu5).

    <title>Oxygen Channels and Fractal Wave-Particle Duality in the Evolution of
  Myoglobin and Neuroglobin</title>
    <summary>  The evolution of terrestrial and aquatic wild type (WT) globins is dominated
by changes in two proximate - distal Histidine ligand exit channels, here
monitored quantitatively by hydropathic waves. These waves reveal allometric
functional features inaccessible to single amino acid stereochemical contact
models, and even very large all-atom Newtonian simulations. The evolutionary
differences between these features between myoglobin and neuroglobin are
related to the two oxidation channels through hydropathic wave analysis, which
identifies subtle interspecies functional differences inaccessible to
traditional size and metabolic scaling studies. Our analysis involves dynamic
synchronization of allometric interactions across entire globins.

    <summary>  The paper presents a novel approach to infer a structuredness in a set of
symbol sequences such as transcriptome nucleotide sequences. A distribution
pattern of triplet frequencies in the Siberian larch (\textit{Larix

study. It was found that the larch transcriptome demonstrates a number of
unexpected symmetries in the statistical and combinatorial properties.

    <title>Metric dynamics for membrane transformation through regulated cell
  proliferation</title>
    <summary>  This study develops an equation for describing three-dimensional membrane
transformation through proliferation of its component cells regulated by
morphogen density distributions on the membrane. The equation is developed in a
two-dimensional coordinate system mapped on the membrane, referred to as the
membrane coordinates. When the membrane expands, the membrane coordinates
expand in the same manner so that the membrane is invariant in the coordinates.
In the membrane coordinate system, the transformation of membrane is described
with a time-derivative equation for metric tensors. By defining relationships
between morphogen density distributions and the direction and rate of cell
division, trajectories of membrane transformation are obtained in terms of the
morphogen distributions. An example of the membrane transformation is shown
numerically.

    <title>Can Bioinformatics Be Considered as an Experimental Biological Science?</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this short report is to reconsider the subject of
bioinformatics as just being a tool of experimental biological science. To do
that, we introduce three examples to show how bioinformatics could be
considered as an experimental science. These examples show how the development
of theoretical biological models generates experimentally verifiable computer
hypotheses, which necessarily must be validated by experiments in vitro or in
vivo.

    <title>Semi-phenomenological classification models of the genetic code(s) using
  q-deformed numbers</title>
    <summary>  The mathematical concept of q-deformations, in particular the one of
qnumbers, is used to study the genetic code(s). After considering two kinds of
q-numbers, for comparison, a phenomenological classification scheme of the
genetic code together with its numerous minor variants is, first, established.
Next, numbers describing the presence of additional amino acids, such as
Selenocysteine or/and Pyrrolysine, are also produced. Finally, a minimal number
of amino acids, which could fit the small number of them which are thought to
have been involved, at the origin of life on Earth, is found. All together,
these results constitute our final semi-phenomenological model.

    <title>Quantitative assessment of increasing complexity</title>
    <summary>  We study the build up of complexity on the example of 1 kg matter in
different forms. We start on the simplest example of ideal gases, and then
continue with more complex chemical, biological, life and social and technical
structures. We assess the complexity of these systems quantitatively, based on
their entropy. We present a method to attribute the same entropy to known
physical systems and to complex organic molecules up to a DNA. The important
steps in this program and the basic obstacles are discussed.

    <title>Configuration Interaction of Hydropathic Waves Enables Ubiquitin
  Functionality</title>
    <summary>  Ubiquitin, discovered less than 50 years ago, tags thousands of diseased
proteins for destruction. It is small (only 76 amino acids), and is found
unchanged in mammals, birds, fish and even worms. Key features of its
functionality are identified here using critical point thermodynamic scaling
theory. These include Fano interference between first- and second-order
elements of globular surface shape transitions. Comparison with its closest
relative, 76 amino acid Nedd8, shows that the latter lacks these features. A
cracked elastic network model is proposed for the common target shared by many
diseased proteins.

    <title>Rethinking the Experiment</title>
    <summary>  The crisis in the reproducibility of experiments invites a re-evaluation of
methods of inquiry and validation procedures. The text challenges current
assumptions of knowledge acquisition and introduces G-complexity for defining
decidable vs. non-decidable knowledge domains. A "second Cartesian revolution,"
informed by and in awareness of anticipatory processes, should result in
scientific methods that transcend determinism and reductionism. Physics and
physics-based disciplines convincingly ascertained themselves by adequately
describing the non-living. A complementary perspective should account for the
specific causality characteristic of life by integrating past, present, and
future. Knowledge about anticipatory processes facilitates attainment of this
goal. Society cannot afford the dead-end street of reductionism. Science,
itself an expression of anticipatory activity, makes possible in our days
alternative understandings of reality and its dynamics.

which has three stages. The first-stage enzyme Uba1 (E1) has evolved only

from yeast and slime mold to fruit flies and humans to subtle changes in its

    <title>Metrics and Harmonic Analysis on DNA</title>
    <summary>  A mathematical algorithm to describe DNA or RNA sequences of $N$ nucleotides
by a string of $2N$ integers numbers is presented in the framework of the so
called crystal basis model of the genetic code. The description allows to
define a not trivial distance between two sequences and to perform the Discrete
Fourier Transform on a sequence. Using the definition of distance the sequence
of $\beta$-globin for Homo, Gallus and Opossum are compared. The Discrete
Fourier Transform for some simple examples is computed.

    <title>Ultrametrics in the genetic code and the genome</title>
    <summary>  Ultrametric approach to the genetic code and the genome is considered and
developed. $p$-Adic degeneracy of the genetic code is pointed out. Ultrametric
tree of the codon space is presented. It is shown that codons and amino acids
can be treated as $p$-adic ultrametric networks. Ultrametric modification of
the Hamming distance is defined and noted how it can be useful. Ultrametric
approach with $p$-adic distance is an attractive and promising trend towards
investigation of bioinformation.

    <title>Analysis of Bacteriostatic Effect of Chinese Herbal Medicine Against
  E.coli</title>
    <summary>  To analyze the bacteriostatic effect of Chinese traditional herbal medicines
on E. coli, total 35 different preparations (decoction, volatile oil and
distillate) of Chinese traditional herbal medicines were tested using plate
culture method. The results showed that 18 preparations of traditional Chinese
herbal medicines have different inhibition effect on E. coli in vitro. The
results also revealed that different process and combination affect the
bacteriostatic effect and different medicines could be used in singles or
combined to treat E.coli disease

in biology because of exceptions is false. The (quantitative) systems biology
offers the potential to solve the Borges Dilemma, by transcending it. There
have already a plenty of indications on this trend.

    <title>Icosahedral packing of RNA viral genomes</title>
    <summary>  Recent studies reveal that certain viruses package a portion of their genome
in a manner that mirrors the icosahedral symmetry of the protein container, or
capsid. Graph theoretical constraints forbid exact realization of icosahedral
symmetry. This paper proposes a model for the determination of
quasi-icosahedral genome structures and discusses the connection between
genomic structure and viral assembly kinetics.

has further deduced from the existence of human intelligence that fundamental
changes in physical theories are needed. I provide an elementary demonstration

    <title>Bifurcations of self-similar solutions of the Fokker-Plank Equation</title>
    <summary>  A class of one-dimensional Fokker-Plank equations having a common stationary
solution, which is a power function of the state of the process, was found. We
prove that these equations also have generalized self-similar solutions which
describe the temporary transition from one stationary state to another. The
study was motivated by problems arising in mathematical modeling of genome size
evolution.

    <title>On the habitability of exoplanets orbiting Proxima Centauri</title>
    <summary>  We apply a mathematical model for photosynthesis to quantitatively assess the
habitability of a hypothetical planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, inside the so
called habitability zone. Results suggest significant viability for primary
biological productivity, provided living organisms have evolved to reach the
ability of using infrared light for photosynthesis.

    <summary>  This note presents a minimal approach to the origin of life, following

As a consequence we propose a characterization of pre-biological states.

    <title>Mathematical models of haploinsufficiency</title>
    <summary>  We study simple mathematical models of gene expression to explore the
possible origins of haploinsufficiency (HI). In a diploid organism, each gene
exists in two copies and when one of these is mutated, the amount of proteins
synthesized is reduced and may fall below a threshold level for the onset of
some desired activity. This can give rise to HI, a manifestation of which is in
the form of a disease. We consider both deterministic and stochastic models of
gene expression and suggest possible scenarios for the occurrence of HI in the
two cases. In the stochastic case, random fluctuations around the mean protein
level give rise to a finite probability that the protein level falls below a
threshold. Increased gene copy number and faster gene expression kinetics
reduce the variance around the mean protein level. The difference between slow
and fast gene expression kinetics, as regards response to a signaling gradient,
is further pointed out. The majority of results reported in the paper are
derived analytically.

    <title>Galilean Satellites as Sites for Incipient Life, and the Earth as its
  Shelter</title>
    <summary>  Numerous problems connected with an assumption of the life origin on the
Earth do not arise on Galilean satellites. Here, in presence of a practically
non-salt water and of a great deal (~5-10%) of abiogenic organics, a great
diversity of conditions, which are unthinkable for the Earth, were realized
more than once. They were caused by global electrochemical processes in the
magnetic field presence what could entail an absolute enantiomeric synthesis.
The subsequent explosions of the satellites' icy envelopes saturated by the
electrolysis products resulted in appearance of hot massive atmospheres and
warm deep oceans and ejection of the dirty ice fragments (=comet nuclei), what
led to the material exchange with other bodies, etc.

    <title>Phase synchronization in cerebral hemodynamics</title>
    <summary>  A healthy human brain is perfused with blood flowing laminarly through
cerebral vessels, providing brain tissue with substrates such as oxygen and
glucose. Under normal conditions, cerebral blood flow is controlled by
autoregulation as well as metabolic, chemical and neurogenic regulation.
Physiological complexity of these mechanisms invariably leads to a question as
to what are the relations between the statistical properties of arterial and
intracranial pressure fluctuations. To shed new light on cerebral hemodynamics,
we employ a complex continuous wavelet transform to determine the instantaneous
phase difference between the arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial
pressure (ICP) in patients with traumatic brain injuries or spontaneous
cerebral hemorrhage. For patients with mild to moderate injury, the phase
difference slowly evolves in time. However, severe neurological injury with
elevated ICP are herein associated with synchronization of arterial and
intracranial pressure. We use Shannon entropy to quantify the stability of
ABP-ICP phase difference and discuss the clinical applicability of such measure
to assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity and autoregulation integrity.

    <title>Applications of Novel Techniques to Health Foods, Medical and
  Agricultural Biotechnology</title>
    <summary>  Selected applications of novel techniques in Agricultural Biotechnology,
Health Food formulations and Medical Biotechnology are being reviewed with the
aim of unraveling future developments and policy changes that are likely to
open new niches for Biotechnology and prevent the shrinking or closing the
existing ones. Amongst the selected novel techniques with applications to both
Agricultural and Medical Biotechnology are: immobilized bacterial cells and
enzymes, microencapsulation and liposome production, genetic manipulation of
microorganisms, development of novel vaccines from plants, epigenomics of
mammalian cells and organisms, as well as biocomputational tools for molecular
modeling related to disease and Bioinformatics. Both fundamental and applied
aspects of the emerging new techniques are being discussed in relation to their
anticipated impact on future biotechnology applications together with policy
changes that are needed for continued success in both Agricultural and Medical
Biotechnology. Several novel techniques are illustrated in an attempt to convey
the most representative and powerful tools that are currently being developed
for both immediate and long term applications in Agriculture, Health Food
formulation and production, pharmaceuticals and Medicine. The research aspects
are naturally emphasized in our review as they are key to further developments
in Medical and Agricultural Biotechnology.

    <title>The dissipative brain</title>
    <summary>  I review the dissipative quantum model of brain and discuss its recent
developments related with the role of entanglement, quantum noise and chaos.
Some comments on consciousness in the frame of the dissipative model are also
presented. Dissipation seems to account for the medial character of
consciousness, for its being in the present (the Now), its un-dividable unity,
its intrinsic subjectivity (autonomy). Finally, essential features of a
conscious artificial device, if ever one can construct it, are briefly
commented upon, also in relation to a device able to exhibit mistakes in its
behavior. The name I give to such a hypothetical device is Spartacus.

    <title>1/f Scaling in Heart Rate Requires Antagonistic Autonomic Control</title>
    <summary>  We present the first systematic evidence for the origins of 1/f-type temporal
scaling in human heart rate. The heart rate is regulated by the activity of two
branches of the autonomic nervous system: the parasympathetic (PNS) and the
sympathetic (SNS) nervous systems. We examine alterations in the scaling
property when the balance between PNS and SNS activity is modified, and find
that the relative PNS suppression by congestive heart failure results in a
substantial increase in the Hurst exponent H towards random walk scaling
$1/f^{2}$ and a similar breakdown is observed with relative SNS suppression by
primary autonomic failure. These results suggest that 1/f scaling in heart rate
requires the intricate balance between the antagonistic activity of PNS and
SNS.

    <title>Graded and Binary Responses in Stochastic Gene Expression</title>
    <summary>  Recently, several theoretical and experimental studies have been undertaken
to probe the effect of stochasticity on gene expression (GE). In experiments,
the GE response to an inducing signal in a cell, measured by the amount of
mRNAs/proteins synthesized, is found to be either graded or binary. The latter
type of response gives rise to a bimodal distribution in protein levels in an
ensemble of cells. One possible origin of binary response is cellular
bistability achieved through positive feedback or autoregulation. In this
paper, we study a simple, stochastic model of GE and show that the origin of
binary response lies exclusively in stochasticity. The transitions between the
active and inactive states of the gene are random in nature. Graded and binary
responses occur in the model depending on the relative stability of the
activated and deactivated gene states with respect to that of
mRNAs/proteins.The theoretical results on binary response provide a good
description of the ``all-or-none'' phenomenon observed in an eukaryotic system.

    <title>The contact network of patients in a regional healthcare system</title>
    <summary>  Yet in spite of advances in hospital treatment, hospitals continue to be a
breeding ground for several airborne diseases and for diseases that are
transmitted through close contacts like SARS, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), norovirus infections and tuberculosis (TB). Here
we extract contact networks for up to 295,108 inpatients for durations up to
two years from a database used for administrating a local public healthcare
system serving a population of 1.9 million individuals. Structural and
dynamical properties of the network of importance for the transmission of
contagious diseases are then analyzed by methods from network epidemiology. The
contact networks are found to be very much determined by an extreme (age
independent) variation in duration of hospital stays and the hospital
structure. We find that that the structure of contacts between in-patients
exhibit structural properties, such as a high level of transitivity,
assortativity and variation in number of contacts, that are likely to be of
importance for the transmission of less contagious diseases. If these
properties are considered when designing prevention programs the risk for and
the effect of epidemic outbreaks may be decreased.

    <title>Discretization of Time Series Data</title>
    <summary>  Data discretization, also known as binning, is a frequently used technique in
computer science, statistics, and their applications to biological data
analysis. We present a new method for the discretization of real-valued data
into a finite number of discrete values. Novel aspects of the method are the
incorporation of an information-theoretic criterion and a criterion to
determine the optimal number of values. While the method can be used for data
clustering, the motivation for its development is the need for a discretization
algorithm for several multivariate time series of heterogeneous data, such as
transcript, protein, and metabolite concentration measurements. As several
modeling methods for biochemical networks employ discrete variable states, the
method needs to preserve correlations between variables as well as the dynamic
features of the time series. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available
from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization .

    <title>Towards a Quantitative, Metabolic Theory for Mammalian Sleep</title>
    <summary>  Sleep is one of the most noticeable and widespread phenomena occurring in
multicellular animals. Nevertheless, no consensus for a theory of its origins
has emerged. In particular, no explicit, quantitative theory exists that
elucidates or distinguishes between the myriad hypotheses proposed for sleep.
Here, we develop a general, quantitative theory for mammalian sleep that
relates many of its fundamental parameters to metabolic rate and body size.
Most mechanisms suggested for the function of sleep can be placed in this
framework, e.g., cellular repair of damage caused by metabolic processes and
cortical reorganization to process sensory input. Our theory leads to
predictions for sleep time, sleep cycle time, and REM (rapid-eye-movement) time
as functions of body and brain mass, and explains, for example, why mice sleep
\~14 hours per day relative to the 3.5 hours per day that elephants sleep. Data
for 96 species of mammals, spanning six orders of magnitude in body size, are
consistent with these predictions and provide strong evidence that time scales
for sleep are set by the brain's, not the whole-body, metabolic rate.

    <title>Modeling stochastic gene expression under repression</title>
    <summary>  Intrinsic transcriptional noise induced by operator fluctuations is
investigated with a simple spin like stochastic model. The effects of
transcriptional fluctuations in protein synthesis is probed by coupling
transcription and translation by an amplificative interaction. In the presence
of repression a new term contributes to the noise which depends on the rate of
mRNA production. If the switching time is small compared with the mRNA life
time the noise is also small. In general the dumping of protein production by a
repressive agent occurs linearly but the fluctuations can show a maxima at
intermediate repression. The discrepancy between the switching time, the mRNA
degradation and protein degradation is crucial for the repressive control in
translation without large fluctuations. The noise profiles obtained here are in
quantitative agreement with recent experiments.

    <title>Ambiguous model learning made unambiguous with 1/f priors</title>
    <summary>  What happens to the optimal interpretation of noisy data when there exists
more than one equally plausible interpretation of the data? In a Bayesian
model-learning framework the answer depends on the prior expectations of the
dynamics of the model parameter that is to be inferred from the data. Local
time constraints on the priors are insufficient to pick one interpretation over
another. On the other hand, nonlocal time constraints, induced by a $1/f$ noise
spectrum of the priors, is shown to permit learning of a specific model
parameter even when there are infinitely many equally plausible interpretations
of the data. This transition is inferred by a remarkable mapping of the model
estimation problem to a dissipative physical system, allowing the use of
powerful statistical mechanical methods to uncover the transition from
indeterminate to determinate model learning.

    <title>Thriving at high hydrostatic pressure: the example of ammonoids (extinct
  cephalopods)</title>
    <summary>  Ammonoids are a group of extinct mollusks belonging to the same class of the
living genus Nautilus (Cephalopoda). In both Nautili and ammonoids, the
(usually planospiral) shell is divided into chambers separated by septa that
during the lifetime were filled with gas at atmospheric pressure. The
intersection of septa with the external shell generates a curve called the
suture line, which in living and most fossil Nautili is fairly uncomplicated.
In contrast, suture lines of ancient ammonoid were gently curved and during the
evolution of the group became highly complex, in some cases so extensively
frilled to be considerable as fractal curves. Numerous theories have been put
forward to explain the complexity of suture ammonoid lines. Calculations
presented here lend support to the hypothesis that complex suture lines aided
in counteracting the effect of the external water pressure. Additionally, it is
found that complex suture lines diminished shell shrinkage caused by water
pressure, and thus aided improve buoyancy. Understanding the reason for complex
sutures in ammonoids does not only represent an important issue in
paleobiology, but is also a challenging problem in the resistance of complex
mechanical structures subjected to high pressure.

    <title>Use of the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the dynamics of protein
  chains</title>
    <summary>  The Metropolis implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed
to study the equilibrium thermodynamics of many-body systems. Choosing small
trial moves, the trajectories obtained applying this algorithm agree with those
obtained by Langevin's dynamics. Applying this procedure to a simplified
protein model, it is possible to show that setting a threshold of 1 degree on
the movement of the dihedrals of the protein backbone in a single Monte Carlo
step, the mean quantities associated with the off-equilibrium dynamics (e.g.,
energy, RMSD, etc.) are well reproduced, while the good description of higher
moments requires smaller moves. An important result is that the time duration
of a Monte Carlo step depends linearly on the temperature, something which
should be accounted for when doing simulations at different temperatures.

    <title>Estimating the Number of Essential Genes in Random Transposon
  Mutagenesis Libraries</title>
    <summary>  Biologists use random transposon mutagenesis to construct knockout libraries
for bacteria. Random mutagenesis offers cost and efficiency benefits over the
standard site directed mutagenesis, but one can no longer ensure that all the
nonessential genes will appear in the library. In random libraries for haploid
organisms, there is always a class of genes for which knockout clones have not
been made, and the members of this class are either essential or nonessential.
One requires statistical methods to estimate the number of essential genes. Two
groups of researchers, Blades and Broman and Jacobs et al., independently and
simultaneously developed methods to do this. Blades and Broman used a Gibbs
sampler and Jacobs et al. used a parametric bootstrap. We compare the
performance of these two methods and find that they both depend on having an
accurate probabilistic model for transposon insertion or on having a library
with a large number of clones. At this point, we do not have good enough
probabilistic models so we must build libraries that have at least five clones
per open reading frame to accurately estimate the number of essential genes.

    <title>Cicada's wings as determinant factor for the sound emission: The case of
  \textit{Quesada gigas}</title>
    <summary>  Cicadas (Homoptera:Cicadidae) are insects able to produce loudly songs and it
is known that the mechanism to produce sound of tymballing cicadas works as a
Helmholtz resonator. In this work we offer evidence on the participation of the
wings in a high quality resonating process which defines the details of the
acoustic properties of the calling song. The study is carry on \textit{Quesada
gigas} species and it is dividied in three stages: (i) the acoustical
characterization of the abdominal cavity, (ii) the record and calculation of
frequency spectrum of the calling song, and (iii) the measurement of the
vibration modes of the wings. The comparison between all the results
unequivocally show the dramatic influence of the wings in the moment in which
the insect emits its calling song.

    <title>Morphogen Transport in Epithelia</title>
    <summary>  We present a general theoretical framework to discuss mechanisms of morphogen
transport and gradient formation in a cell layer. Trafficking events on the
cellular scale lead to transport on larger scales. We discuss in particular the
case of transcytosis where morphogens undergo repeated rounds of
internalization into cells and recycling. Based on a description on the
cellular scale, we derive effective nonlinear transport equations in one and
two dimensions which are valid on larger scales. We derive analytic expressions
for the concentration dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient and the
effective degradation rate. We discuss the effects of a directional bias on
morphogen transport and those of the coupling of the morphogen and receptor
kinetics. Furthermore, we discuss general properties of cellular transport
processes such as the robustness of gradients and relate our results to recent
experiments on the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) that acts in the fruit fly
Drosophila.

    <title>Using graph concepts to understand the organization of complex systems</title>
    <summary>  Complex networks are universal, arising in fields as disparate as sociology,
physics, and biology. In the past decade, extensive research into the
properties and behaviors of complex systems has uncovered surprising
commonalities among the topologies of different systems. Attempts to explain
these similarities have led to the ongoing development and refinement of
network models and graph-theoretical analysis techniques with which to
characterize and understand complexity. In this tutorial, we demonstrate
through illustrative examples, how network measures and models have contributed
to the elucidation of the organization of complex systems.

    <title>Exploring the assortativity-clustering space of a network's degree
  sequence</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays there is a multitude of measures designed to capture different
aspects of network structure. To be able to say if the structure of certain
network is expected or not, one needs a reference model (null model). One
frequently used null model is the ensemble of graphs with the same set of
degrees as the original network. In this paper we argue that this ensemble can
be more than just a null model -- it also carries information about the
original network and factors that affect its evolution. By mapping out this
ensemble in the space of some low-level network structure -- in our case those
measured by the assortativity and clustering coefficients -- one can for
example study how close to the valid region of the parameter space the observed
networks are. Such analysis suggests which quantities are actively optimized
during the evolution of the network. We use four very different biological
networks to exemplify our method. Among other things, we find that high
clustering might be a force in the evolution of protein interaction networks.
We also find that all four networks are conspicuously robust to both random
errors and targeted attacks.

    <title>Genetic Code: A New Understanding of Codon - Amino Acid Assignment</title>
    <summary>  In this work it is shown that 20 canonical amino acids (AAs) within genetic
code appear to be a whole system with strict AAs positions; more exactly, with
AAs ordinal number in three variants; first variant 00-19, second 00-21 and
third 00-20. The ordinal number follows from the positions of belonging codons,
i.e. their digrams (or doublets). The reading itself is a reading in quaternary
numbering system if four bases possess the values within a specific logical
square: A = 0, C = 1, G = 2, U = 3. By this, all splittings, distinctions and
classifications of AAs appear to be in accordance to atom and nucleon number
balance as well as to the other physico-chemical properties, such as
hydrophobicity and polarity.

    <title>Compression stress in opposite wood of angiosperms: observations in
  chestnut, mani and poplar</title>
    <summary>  In order to face environmental constraints, trees are able to re-orient their
axes by controlling the stress level in the newly formed wood layers.
Angiosperms and gymnosperms evolved into two distinct mechanisms: the former
produce a wood with large tension pre-stress on the upper side of the tilted
axis, while the latter produce a wood with large compression pre-stress on the
lower side. In both cases, the difference between this stress level and that of
the opposite side, in light tension, generates the bending of the axis.
However, light values of compression were sometimes measured in the opposite
side of angiosperms. By analysing old data on chestnut and mani and new data on
poplar, this study shows that these values were not measurement artefacts. This
reveals that generating light compression stress in opposite wood contributes
to improve the performance of the re-orientation mechanism.

    <title>Gene expression from polynomial dynamics in the 2-adic information space</title>
    <summary>  We perform geometrization of genetics by representing genetic information by
points of the 4-adic {\it information space.} By well known theorem of number
theory this space can also be represented as the 2-adic space. The process of
DNA-reproduction is described by the action of a 4-adic (or equivalently
2-adic) dynamical system. As we know, the genes contain information for
production of proteins. The genetic code is a degenerate map of codons to
proteins. We model this map as functioning of a polynomial dynamical system.
The purely mathematical problem under consideration is to find a dynamical
system reproducing the degenerate structure of the genetic code. We present one
of possible solutions of this problem.

    <title>The G-Ball, a New Icon for Codon Symmetry and the Genetic Code</title>
    <summary>  A codon table is a useful tool for mapping codons to amino acids as they have
been assigned by nature. It has become a scientific icon because of the way it
embodies our understanding of this natural process and the way it immediately
communicates this understanding. However, advancements in molecular biology
over the past several decades must lead to a realization that our basic
understanding of genetic translation is fundamentally flawed and incomplete,
and, therefore, our icon is inadequate. A better understanding of symmetry and
an appreciation for the essential role it has played in codon formation will
improve our understanding of nature's coding processes. Incorporation of that
symmetry into our icon will facilitate that improvement.

    <title>Dimensionality and dynamics in the behavior of C. elegans</title>
    <summary>  A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying
simplicity in complex motor actions. Here we show that the space of shapes
adopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just
four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially
reconstruct "equations of motion" for the dynamics in this space. These
dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a
rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.
Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can
generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the
worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively "steering" the
worm in real time.

    <title>p-Adic Modelling of the Genome and the Genetic Code</title>
    <summary>  The present paper is devoted to foundations of p-adic modelling in genomics.
Considering nucleotides, codons, DNA and RNA sequences, amino acids, and
proteins as information systems, we have formulated the corresponding p-adic
formalisms for their investigations. Each of these systems has its
characteristic prime number used for construction of the related information
space. Relevance of this approach is illustrated by some examples. In
particular, it is shown that degeneration of the genetic code is a p-adic
phenomenon. We have also put forward a hypothesis on evolution of the genetic
code assuming that primitive code was based on single nucleotides and
chronologically first four amino acids. This formalism of p-adic genomic
information systems can be implemented in computer programs and applied to
various concrete cases.

    <title>New method for the study of psychotropic drug effects under simulated
  clinical conditions</title>
    <summary>  The sensory contact model allows forming different psychopathological states
(anxious depression, catalepsy, social withdrawal, pathological aggression,
hypersensitivity, cognition disturbances, anhedonia, alcoholism etc.) produced
by repeated agonistic interactions in male mice and investigating the
therapeutic and preventive properties of any drug as well as its efficiency
under simulated clinical conditions. This approach can be useful for a better
understanding of the drugs' action in different stages of disease development
in individuals. It is suggested that this pharmacological approach may be
applied for the screening of different novel psychotropic drugs.

    <title>Dynamics of glucose-lactose diauxic growth in E. coli</title>
    <summary>  We present a mathematical model of glucose-lactose diauxic growth in
Escherichia coli including both the postive and negative regulation mechanisms
of the lactose operon as well as the inducer exclusion. To validate this model,
we first calculated the time evolution of beta-galactosidase for only the
lactose nutrient and compared the numerical results with experimental data.
Second, we compared the calculated cell biomass of the glucose-lactose diauxic
growth with the experimental optical density of the diauxic growth for a
particular E. coli MG 1655. For both cases, the numerical calculations from
this model are in good agreement with these two experiments' data. The diauxic
growth pattern of a wild type E. coli was also investigated.

    <title>Top-Down Causation by Information Control: From a Philosophical Problem
  to a Scientific Research Program</title>
    <summary>  It has been claimed that different types of causes must be considered in
biological systems, including top-down as well as same-level and bottom-up
causation, thus enabling the top levels to be causally efficacious in their own
right. To clarify this issue, important distinctions between information and
signs are introduced here and the concepts of information control and
functional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used
to characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens, in a way
that is testable. The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence
classes of lower level processes, realised in biological systems through
different operations having the same outcome within the context of information
control and networks.

    <title>Nucleosome shape dictates chromatin-fiber structure</title>
    <summary>  Apart from being the gateway for all access to the eukaryotic genome,
chromatin has in recent years been identified as carrying an epigenetic code
regulating transcriptional activity. The detailed knowledge of this code
contrasts the ignorance of the fiber structure which it regulates, and none of
the suggested fiber models are capable of predicting the most basic quantities
of the fiber (diameter, nucleosome line density, etc.). We address this
three-decade-old problem by constructing a simple geometrical model based on
the nucleosome shape alone. Without fit parameters we predict the observed
properties of the condensed chromatin fiber (e.g. its 30 nm diameter), the
structure, and how the fiber changes with varying nucleosome repeat length. Our
approach further puts the plethora of previously suggested models within a
coherent framework, and opens the door to detailed studies of the interplay
between chromatin structure and function.

    <title>Induction level determines signature of gene expression noise in
  cellular systems</title>
    <summary>  Noise in gene expression, either due to inherent stochasticity or to varying
inter- and intracellular environment, can generate significant cell-to-cell
variability of protein levels in clonal populations. We present a theoretical
framework, based on stochastic processes, to quantify the different sources of
gene expression noise taking cell division explicitly into account. Analytical,
time-dependent solutions for the noise contributions arising from the major
steps involved in protein synthesis are derived. The analysis shows that the
induction level of the activator or transcription factor is crucial for the
characteristic signature of the dominant source of gene expression noise and
thus bridges the gap between seemingly contradictory experimental results.
Furthermore, on the basis of experimentally measured cell distributions, our
simulations suggest that transcription factor binding and promoter activation
can be modelled independently of each other with sufficient accuracy.

    <title>Towards an unifying perspective of the fundamental properties and
  structural principles governing the immune system</title>
    <summary>  In the study of the basic properties observed in the immune system and, in a
broader view, in biological systems, several concepts have already been
mathematically formulated or treated in an analytical perspective, such as
degeneracy, robustness, noise, and bow tie architecture. These properties,
among others, seem to rule many aspects of the system functioning, and share
among themselvesseveral characteristics, intersecting each other, and often
becoming one the indivisible part of the other. According to Kitano, systems
biology needs solid theoretical and methodological foundation of principles and
properties, able to lead towards a unified perspective. An effort in unifying
the formalization and analysis of these principles can be now timely attempted.

    <title>The degeneracy of the genetic code and Hadamard matrices</title>
    <summary>  The matrix form of the presentation of the genetic code is described as the
cognitive form to analyze structures of the genetic code. A similar matrix form
is utilized in the theory of signal processing. The Kronecker family of the
genetic matrices is investigated, which is based on the genetic matrix [C A; U
G], where C, A, U, G are the letters of the genetic alphabet. This matrix in
the third Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.
Peculiarities of the degeneracy of the vertebrate mitochondria genetic code are
reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic
(8*8)-matrix. This mosaic matrix is connected algorithmically with Hadamard
matrices unexpectedly, which are famous in the theory of signal processing,
spectral analysis, quantum mechanics and quantum computers. A special
decomposition of numeric genetic matrices reveals their close relations with a
family of 8-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (not Cayley's octonions). Some
hypothesis and thoughts are formulated on the basis of these phenomenological
facts.

    <title>A microstructurally informed model for the mechanical response of
  three-dimensional actin networks</title>
    <summary>  We propose a class of microstructurally informed models for the linear
elastic mechanical behavior of cross-linked polymer networks such as the actin
cytoskeleton. Salient features of the models include the possibility to
represent anisotropic mechanical behavior resulting from anisotropic filament
distributions, and a power-law scaling of the mechanical properties with the
filament density. Mechanical models within the class are parameterized by seven
different constants. We demonstrate a procedure for determining these constants
using finite element models of three-dimensional actin networks. Actin
filaments and cross-links were modeled as elastic rods, and the networks were
constructed at physiological volume fractions and at the scale of an image
voxel. We show the performance of the model in estimating the mechanical
behavior of the networks over a wide range of filament densities and degrees of
anisotropy.

    <title>Developing a Theoretical Framework for Optofluidic Device Designing for
  System Identification in Systems Biology: the EGFR Study Case</title>
    <summary>  Identification of dynamics underlying biochemical pathways of interest in
oncology is a primary goal in current systems biology. Understanding structures
and interactions that govern the evolution of such systems is believed to be a
cornerstone in this research. Systems theory and systems identification theory
are primary resources for this task since they both provide a self consistent
framework for modelling and manipulating models of dynamical systems that are
best suited for the problem under investigation. We address herein the issue of
obtaining an informative dataset ZN to be used as starting point for
identification of EGFR pathway dynamics. In order to match experimental
identifiability criteria we propose a theoretical framework for input stimulus
design based on dynamical properties of the system under investigation. A
feasible optofluidic design has been designed on the basis of the spectral
properties of the driving inputs that maximize information content after the
theoretical studies.

    <title>Maximum Power Efficiency and Criticality in Random Boolean Networks</title>
    <summary>  Random Boolean networks are models of disordered causal systems that can
occur in cells and the biosphere. These are open thermodynamic systems
exhibiting a flow of energy that is dissipated at a finite rate. Life does work
to acquire more energy, then uses the available energy it has gained to perform
more work. It is plausible that natural selection has optimized many biological
systems for power efficiency: useful power generated per unit fuel. In this
letter we begin to investigate these questions for random Boolean networks
using Landauer's erasure principle, which defines a minimum entropy cost for
bit erasure. We show that critical Boolean networks maximize available power
efficiency, which requires that the system have a finite displacement from
equilibrium. Our initial results may extend to more realistic models for cells
and ecosystems.

    <title>Analytical Equations to the Chromaticity Cone: Algebraic Methods for
  Describing Color</title>
    <summary>  We describe an affine transformation on the (CIE) color matching functions
and map the spectral locus as a circle. We then homogenize the right circular
cylinder erected by the circle, with respect to a normalizing plane and develop
an analytical equation to the chromaticity cone, for the spectral colors. In
the interior of the (CIE) chromaticity diagram, by homogenizing elliptic
cylinders with respect to the normalizing planes, analytical equations to
subsets (also cones) of the chromaticity cone are developed. These equations
provide an algebraic method for describing color perception. As an application
of the interior chromaticity cones, we demonstrate that by sectioning
homogenized cones with planes and projecting, analytical equations to the
Macadam ellipses may be derived. Further, the cone equations are used to
propose new types of color order systems.

    <title>Drug absorption through a cell monolayer: a theoretical work on a
  non-linear three-compartment model</title>
    <summary>  The subject of analysis is a non-linear three-compartment model, widely used
in pharmacological absorption studies. It has been transformed into a general
form, thus leading automatically to an appropriate approximation. This made the
absorption profile accessible and expressions for absorption times, apparent
permeabilities and equilibrium values were given. These findings allowed a
profound analysis of results from non-linear curve fits and delivered the
dependencies on the systems' parameters over a wide range of values. The
results were applied to an absorption experiment with multidrug
transporter-affected antibiotic CNV97100 on Caco-2 cell monolayers.

    <title>Anapedesis: Implications and Applications of Bio-Structural Robustness</title>
    <summary>  Here we develop an approach to bio-structural robustness integrated with
structure-function relationship in a unified conceptual and methodological
framework, and envision its study using adequate computational and experimental
methods. To distinguish this structural robustness from the abstract
organizational robustness of systems, we call it anapedesis, and define it as
the scale-independent property of biological objects, from biomolecules to
organisms, to deform and recover while minimizing and/or repairing the damage
produced by stretch. We propose to study the consequences of deformation of
biological objects closer to their structural and/or functional failure than
previously considered relevant. We show that structural robustness is present
as a basic principle in many facets of biomedicine: many pathological
conditions may derive from the failure of molecules, cells and their
higher-order assemblies to maintain robustness against deformation.
Furthermore, structural robustness could have been the key selective criterion
during pre-biotic evolution and afterwards, and its universality can be
demonstrated by modeling using genetic algorithms. Thus, the specific
investigation of bio-structural robustness as anapedesis could help the solving
of fundamental problems of biology and medicine.

    <title>A (possible) mathematical model to describe biological
  "context-dependence" : case study with protein structure</title>
    <summary>  Context-dependent nature of biological phenomena are well documented in every
branch of biology. While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)
model various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general
mathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes
the students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'
as well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to
describe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different
branches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be
transitive but non-commutative. It is found that a hierarchical nature of
dependence amongst the biological contexts models the emergent biological
properties efficiently. Reasons for these findings are provided with a general
model to describe biological reality. Scheme to algorithmically implement the
hierarchic structure of organization of biological contexts was achieved with a
construct named 'Context tree'. A 'Context tree' based analysis of context
interactions among biophysical factors influencing protein structure was
performed.

    <title>A Molecular Mass Gradient is the Key Parameter of the Genetc Code
  Organization</title>
    <summary>  The structure of the genetic code is discussed in formal terms. A rectangular
table of the code ("the code matrix"), whose properties reveal its arithmetical
content tagged with the information symbols in several notations. New
parameters used to analyze of the code matrix, the serial numbers of the
encoded products and coding elements, ordered by molecular mass. The structural
similarity of the amino acid sequences corresponding to two aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases classes is found. The code matrix shows how can be organized the
so-called second genetic code. The symmetrical pattern of the matrix is
supported with the other parameters; it also serves as a basis to construct a
3D model of the genetic code which follows the structure of the simplest Plato
solid, tetrahedron. The reasons for this unusual structure of the genetic code
remains unclear.

    <title>A Unified Theory on Construction and Evolution of the Genetic Code</title>
    <summary>  A quantitative theory on the construction and the evolution of the genetic
code is proposed. Through introducing the concept of mutational deterioration
(MD) and developing a theoretical formalism on MD minimization we have proved:
1, the redundancy distribution of codons in the genetic code obeys MD
minimization principle; 2, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic distribution of amino
acids on the code table is global MD (GMD) minimal; 3, the standard genetic
code can be deduced from the adaptive minimization of GMD; 4, the variants of
the standard genetic code can be explained quantitatively by use of GMD
formalism and the general trend of the evolution is GMD non-increasing which
reflects the selection on the code. We have demonstrated that the redundancy
distribution of codons and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (H-P) distribution of
amino acids are robust in the code relative to the mutational parameter, and
indicated that the GMD can be looked as a non-fitness function on the adaptive
landscape. Finally, an important aspect on the symmetry of the code
construction, the Yin-Yang duality is investigated. The Yin-Yang duality among
codons affords a sound basis for understanding the H-P structure in the genetic
code.

    <title>Multiple positive steady states in subnetworks defined by stoichiometric
  generators</title>
    <summary>  In Systems Biology there is a growing interest in the question, whether or
not a given mathematical model can admit more than one steady state. As
parameter values are often unknown or subject to a very high uncertainty, one
is often interested in the question, whether or not a given mathematical model
can, for some conceivable parameter vector, exhibit multistationarity at all. A
partial answer to this question is given in Feinberg's deficiency one
algorithm. This algorithm can decide about multistationarity by analyzing
systems of linear inequalities that are independent of parameter values.
However, the deficiency one algorithm is limited to what its author calls
regular deficiency one networks. Many realistic networks have a deficiency
higher than one, thus the algorithm cannot be applied directly. In a previous
publication it was suggested to analyze certain well defined subnetworks that
are guaranteed to be of deficiency one. Realistic reaction networks, however,
often lead to subnetworks that are irregular, especially if metabolic networks
are considered. Here the special structure of the subnetworks is used to derive
conditions for multistationarity. These conditions are independent of the
regularity conditions required by the deficiency one algorithm. Thus, in
particular, these conditions are applicable to irregular subnetworks.

    <title>A Hybrid Agent Based and Differential Equation Model of Body Size
  Effects on Pathogen Replication and Immune System Response</title>
    <summary>  Many emerging pathogens infect multiple host species, and multi-host
pathogens may have very different dynamics in different host species. This
research addresses how pathogen replication rates and Immune System (IS)
response times are constrained by host body size. An Ordinary Differential
Equation (ODE) model is used to show that pathogen replication rates decline
with host body size but IS response rates remain invariant with body size. An
Agent-Based Model (ABM) is used to investigate two models of IS architecture
that could explain scale invariance of IS response rates. A stage structured
hybrid model is proposed that strikes a balance between the detailed
representation of an ABM and computational tractability of an ODE, by using
them in the initial and latter stages of an infection, respectively.

    <title>Are mental properties supervenient on brain properties?</title>
    <summary>  The "mind-brain supervenience" conjecture suggests that all mental properties
are derived from the physical properties of the brain. To address the question
of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience
hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified
version of supervenience (called epsilon-supervenience) that is amenable to
experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this
approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the
probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided
determination of epsilon-supervenience. The physical property of the brain
employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the
brain-graph or connectome). epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine
whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to
within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the
relationship between the two. This may provide motivation for
cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.

    <title>Optimization of Production Protocol of Alkaline Protease by Streptomyces
  pulvereceus</title>
    <summary>  Extra cellular alkaline protease producing species is an isolate from soil
which was characterized and identified as Streptomyces pulvereceus MTCC 8374.
Studies on submerged fermentation revealed that maximum level of enzyme
production was during early stationary phase. Optimum pH, inoculum and
temperature were 9.0, 3 percent and 33 C respectively. Among carbon sources 0.3
peccent starch gave a maximum production followed by maltose, xylose and
fructose. High yield of protease production was reported with 1.0 percent
casein followed by soybean meal, yeast extract and malt extract. Further, it
was optimized with 0.5 percent, 1.0 percentand 1.5 percent of NaCl among which
1 percent NaCl resulted in maximum level of protease. The protease profile of
the isolate shows its potential as a good source for industrial application.

    <title>The shade avoidance syndrome: a non-markovian stochastic growth model</title>
    <summary>  Plants at high population density compete for light, showing a series of
physiological responses known as the shade avoidance syndrome. These responses
are controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two
signals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin
signal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth
can be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided
that the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are
bimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of
isolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the
growth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.
Moreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the
biomass production function of an independent model. These results suggest that
memory effects play a non-negligible role in plant growth processes.

    <title>A 2-dimensional Geometry for Biological Time</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes an abstract mathematical frame for describing some
features of biological time. The key point is that usual physical (linear)
representation of time is insufficient, in our view, for the understanding key
phenomena of life, such as rhythms, both physical (circadian, seasonal ...) and
properly biological (heart beating, respiration, metabolic ...). In particular,
the role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any counterpart in
mathematical formalization of physical clocks, which are based on frequencies
along the usual (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then suggest
a functional representation of biological time by a 2-dimensional manifold as a
mathematical frame for accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The
"visual" representation of rhythms so obtained, in particular heart beatings,
will provide, by a few examples, hints towards possible applications of our
approach to the understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific
pathologies. The 3-dimensional embedding space, needed for purely mathematical
reasons, allows to introduce a suitable extra-dimension for "representation
time", with a cognitive significance.

    <title>Protention and retention in biological systems</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes an abstract mathematical frame for describing some
features of cognitive and biological time. We focus here on the so called
"extended present" as a result of protentional and retentional activities
(memory and anticipation). Memory, as retention, is treated in some physical
theories (relaxation phenomena, which will inspire our approach), while
protention (or anticipation) seems outside the scope of physics. We then
suggest a simple functional representation of biological protention. This
allows us to introduce the abstract notion of "biological inertia".

    <title>Matrix genetics, part 5: genetic projection operators and direct sums</title>
    <summary>  The article is devoted to phenomena of symmetries and algebras in matrix
presentations of the genetic code. The Kronecker family of the genetic matrices
is investigated, which is based on the alphabetical matrix [C A; U G], where C,
A, U, G are the letters of the genetic alphabet. The matrix P=[C A; U G] in the
third Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.
Peculiarities of the degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the
symmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets.
Phenomena of connections of this mosaic matrix (and many other genetic
matrices) with projection operators are revealed. Taking into account an
important role of projection operators in quantum mechanics, theory of digital
codes, computer science, logic and in many other fields of applied mathematics,
we study algebraic properties and biological meanings of these phenomena. Using
of notions and formalisms of theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces in
bioinformatics and theoretical biology is proposed on the bases of the
described results.

    <summary>  The lecture summarises main results of my team over last five years in the
field of technical experiment design and interpretation of results of
experiments for cell bi-ology. I introduce the theoretical concept of the
experiment, based mainly on ideqas of stochastic systems theory, and confront
it with general ideas of systems theory. In the next part I introduce available
experiments and discuss their information con-tent. Namely, I show that light
microscopy may be designed to give resolution com-parable to that of electron
microscopy and that may be used for experiments using living cells. I show
avenues to objective analysis of cell behavior observation. I pro-pose new
microscope design, which shall combine advantages of all methods, and steps to
be taken to build a model of living cells with predictive power for practical
use

  Abstract: The development of new drugs is a problem that nowadays has no
solution in terms of computational power due to the lack of software for
handling the big volume of available information; besides, these data are
stored in multiple formats and are distributed all around the world. To resolve
that, a development of an in silico drug design methodology.

    <title>Fluctuation-driven Turing patterns</title>
    <summary>  Models of diffusion driven pattern formation that rely on the Turing
mechanism are utilized in many areas of science. However, many such models
suffer from the defect of requiring fine tuning of parameters or an unrealistic
separation of scales in the diffusivities of the constituents of the system in
order to predict the formation of spatial patterns. In the context of a very
generic model of ecological pattern formation, we show that the inclusion of
intrinsic noise in Turing models leads to the formation of "quasi-patterns"
that form in generic regions of parameter space and are experimentally
distinguishable from standard Turing patterns. The existence of quasi-patterns
removes the need for unphysical fine tuning or separation of scales in the
application of Turing models to real systems.

    <title>Biological Concepts Instrument (BCI): A diagnostic tool for revealing
  student thinking</title>
    <summary>  A key to effective teaching is an awareness and accurate understanding of the
thinking and implicit assumptions that students bring to the subject to be
learned. In the absence of extensive Socratic interactions with students, one
strategy to assess student thinking involves the use of concept inventories
(CIs). CIs are typically multiple-choice assessments, constructed based on
research into student thinking and language, and designed to reveal the
presence of common misconceptions and implicit assumptions pertaining to a
particular facet of a subject. Here we describe the open-source Biological
Concepts Instrument (BCI), a diagnostic, multiple-choice instrument designed to
provide instructors with a preliminary map of a number of basic ideas in
molecular level biology. We describe the strategy behind its design, the
research upon which it is based, item construction, and its possible uses as a
means to reveal and address persistent and often unrecognized conceptual
obstacles.

    <title>The human genome and drug discovery after a decade. Roads (still) not
  taken</title>
    <summary>  The draft sequence of the human genome became available almost a decade ago
but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric
analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be
"druggable", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were
known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical
research system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark
matter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed
to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few
genome-derived targets have led to approved drugs.

    <summary>  Symmetries play a major role in physics, in particular since the work by E.
Noether and H. Weyl in the first half of last century. Herein, we briefly
review their role by recalling how symmetry changes allow to conceptually move
from classical to relativistic and quantum physics. We then introduce our
ongoing theoretical analysis in biology and show that symmetries play a
radically different role in this discipline, when compared to those in current
physics. By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in
relation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the
theories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various
levels of organization, are not "just" processes, but permanent (extended, in
our terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the
limits of a relative structural stability (or interval of viability),
variability is at the core of these transitions.

    <title>Randomness and Multi-level Interactions in Biology</title>
    <summary>  The dynamic instability of the living systems and the "superposition" of
different forms of randomness are viewed as a component of the contingently
increasing organization of life along evolution. We briefly survey how
classical and quantum physics define randomness differently. We then discuss
why this requires, in our view, an enrichment of the understanding of the
effects of their concurrent presence in biological systems' dynamics.
Biological randomness is then presented as an essential component of the
heterogeneous determination and intrinsic unpredictability proper to life
phenomena, due to the nesting and interaction of many levels of organization.
Even increasing organization itself induces growing disorder, by energy
dispersal effects of course, but also by variability and differentiation.
Co-operation between diverse components in networks implies at the same time
the presence of constraints due to the peculiar forms of (bio-)resonance and
(bio-)entanglement we discuss.

    <title>The interplay of mutations and electronic properties in disease-related
  genes</title>
    <summary>  Electronic properties of DNA are believed to play a crucial role in many
phenomena in living organisms, for example the location of DNA lesions by base
excision repair (BER) glycosylases and the regulation of tumor-suppressor genes
such as p53 by detection of oxidative damage. However, the reproducible
measurement and modelling of charge migration through DNA molecules at the
nanometer scale remains a challenging and controversial subject even after more
than a decade of intense efforts. Here we show, by analysing 162
disease-related genes from a variety of medical databases with a total of
almost 20,000 observed pathogenic mutations, a significant difference in the
electronic properties of the population of observed mutations compared to the
set of all possible mutations. Our results have implications for the role of
the electronic properties of DNA in cellular processes, and hint at the
possibility of prediction, early diagnosis and detection of mutation hotspots.

    <title>Experimental Researches of Cutaneous Melanoma Immunotherapy by Antitumor
  Cell-Whole GM-CSF-Producing Vaccines</title>
    <summary>  Various approaches to increase efficiency of antitumor therapy by a
combination of vaccinotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical excision of primary
tumor nodes, and also the comparative analyses of therapeutic and preventive
application of antitumoral vaccines were carried out in melanoma experimental
model. It was postulated that preventive vaccination is able to prevent tumor
incidence by 70 %. The combination of vaccinotherapy and surgical treatment of
melanoma increases antimetastatic activity of vaccination by 43 %. We conclude
the combined therapy would lead to more effective antitumor response.

    <title>On Programs and Genomes</title>
    <summary>  We outline the global control architecture of genomes. A theory of genomic
control information is presented. The concept of a developmental control
network called a cene (for control gene) is introduced. We distinguish
parts-genes from control genes or cenes. Cenes are interpreted and executed by
the cell and, thereby, direct cell actions including communication, growth,
division, differentiation and multi-cellular development. The cenome is the
global developmental control network in the genome. The cenome is also a cene
that consists of interlinked sub-cenes that guide the ontogeny of the organism.
The complexity of organisms is linked to the complexity of the cenome. The
relevance to ontogeny and evolution is mentioned. We introduce the concept of a
universal cell and a universal genome.

    <title>Optimization of brain and life performance: Striving for playing at the
  top for the long run</title>
    <summary>  In this essay written with my students and collaborators in mind, I share
simple recipes that are easy and often fun to put in practice and that make a
big difference in one's life. The seven guiding principles are: (1) sleep, (2)
love and sex, (3) deep breathing and daily exercises, (4) water and chewing,
(5) fruits, unrefined products, food combination, vitamin D and no meat, (6)
power foods, (7) play, intrinsic motivation, positive psychology and will.
These simple laws are based on an integration of evolutionary thinking,
personal experimentation, and evidence from experiments reported in the
scientific literature. I develop their rationality, expected consequences and
describe briefly how to put them in practice. I hope that professionals and the
broader public may also find some use for it, as I have seen already the
positive impacts on some of my students.

    <title>New Osmosis Law and Theory: the New Formula that Replaces van't Hoff
  Osmotic Pressure Equation</title>
    <summary>  This article derived a new abstract concept from the osmotic process and
concluded it via "osmotic force" with a new law -- "osmotic law". The "osmotic
law" describes that, in an osmotic system, osmolyte moves osmotically from the
side with higher "osmotic force" to the side with lower "osmotic force". In
addition, it was proved mathematically that the osmotic process could be
explained perfectly via "osmotic force" and "osmotic laws", which can prevent
the difficulties in using current "osmotic pressure" concept to explain the
osmotic process and phenomenon. A theory and equation to describe the curve of
osmotic pressure vs. different ideal solution concentrations are also derived,
which can overcome the limitedness and incompleteness of van't Hoff osmotic
pressure formula (a linear equation) which is applicable to ideal dilute
solution only.

    <title>p-Adic Structure of the Genetic Code</title>
    <summary>  The genetic code is connection between 64 codons, which are building blocks
of the genes, and 20 amino acids, which are building blocks of the proteins. In
addition to coding amino acids, a few codons code stop signal, which is at the
end of genes, i.e. it terminates process of protein synthesis. This article is
a review of simple modelling of the genetic code and related subjects by
concept of p-adic distance. It also contains some new results. In particular,
the article presents appropriate structure of the codon space, degeneration and
possible evolution of the genetic code. p-Adic modelling of the genetic code is
viewed as the first step in further application of p-adic tools in the
information sector of life science.

    <title>Health Matters: Human Organ Donations, Sales, and the Black Market</title>
    <summary>  In this paper I explore the human organ procurement system. Which is better
for saving lives and limiting black market use, the present altruistic system
of donations or a free and open sales market? I explain that there is a risk
with maintaining the present system, the altruistic vision, and that people may
die who might otherwise live if the sale of organs was permitted. But there is
no guarantee that permitting organ sales would effectively address the current
supply-side shortage and global use of the black market. In addition to
discussing the implications of these procurement systems, I look at methods to
increase organ donations and I explore the differences between presumed and
explicit consent. Ultimately, I conclude that the altruistic donation system,
bolstered by the addition of a policy of presumed consent and appropriate
financial incentives, is a better choice than a legal sales market in spite of
its shortcomings.

    <title>Quantifying Limits to Detection of Early Warning for Critical
  Transitions</title>
    <summary>  Catastrophic regime shifts in complex natural systems may be averted through
advanced detection. Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many
systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the
lens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return
times. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty
involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their
expected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls, or
hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable
different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are
to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model based approach in order to
quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow
comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be
quite severe for common indicators even under favorable assumptions, and also
illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We
demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in
different data sets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more
central part of early warning predictions.

    <title>Dyadic groups, dyadic trees and symmetries in long nucleotide sequences</title>
    <summary>  The conception of multi-alphabetical genetics is represented. Matrix forms of
the representation of the multi-level system of molecular-genetic alphabets
have revealed algebraic properties of this system. These properties are
connected with well-known notions of dyadic groups and dyadic-shift matrices.
Matrix genetics shows relations of the genetic alphabets with some types of
hypercomplex numbers including dual numbers and bicomplex numbers together with
their extensions. A possibility of new approach is mentioned to simulate
genetically inherited phenomena of biological spirals and phyllotaxis laws on
the base of screw theory and Fibonacci matrices. Dyadic trees for sub-sets of
triplets of the whole human genome are constructed. A new notion is put forward
about square matrices with internal complementarities on the base of genetic
matrices. Initial results of the study of such matrices are described. Our
results testify that living matter possesses a profound algebraic essence. They
show new promising ways to develop algebraic biology.

    <title>Parent-offspring Conflict in feral dogs: A Bioassay</title>
    <summary>  The parent-offspring conflict theory is an interesting premise for
understanding the dynamics of parental care. However, this theory is not easy
to test empirically, as exact measures of parental investment in an
experimental set-up are difficult to obtain. We have used the Indian feral dog
as a model system to test the POC theory in their natural habitat in the
context of the mother's tendency to share food given by humans with her pups in
the weaning and post-weaning stage. Our behavioural bioassay convincingly
demonstrates an increase of conflict and decrease of cooperation by the mother
with her offspring over a span of 4-6 weeks. We also demonstrate that the
conflict is intentional, and is not influenced by the hunger levels of the pups
or the litter size.

previously uncharacterized physical property of DNA, the incorporation reaction
chemical potential {\Delta}{\mu}. We use the combination of graph theory and
statistical thermodynamics to derive entromics - a series of results providing
the thermodynamic model of {\Delta}{\mu}. We also show that {\Delta}{\mu}i is
quantitatively characterized as incorporation entropy. We present formulae for
computing {\Delta}{\mu} from the genome DNA sequence. We then derive important
restrictions on DNA properties and genome assembly that follow from
thermodynamic properties of {\Delta}{\mu}. Finally, we show how these genome
assembly restrictions lead directly to the evolution of detectable coherences
in incorporation entropy along the entire genome. Examples of entromic
applications, demonstrating functional and biological importance are shown.

    <title>Affordability, cost and cost-effectiveness of universal anti-retroviral
  therapy for HIV</title>
    <summary>  If people at risk of HIV infection are tested annually and started on
treatment as soon as they are found to be HIV-positive it should be possible to
reduce the case reproduction number for HIV to less than one, eliminate
transmission and end the epidemic. If this is to be done it is essential to
know if it would be affordable, and cost effective. Here we show that in all
but eleven countries of the world it is affordable by those countries, that in
these eleven countries it is affordable for the international community, and in
all countries it is highly cost-effective.

    <title>Potential of Traditional Medicinal Plants for Treating Obesity: A Review</title>
    <summary>  Obesity is a global health concern associated with high morbidity and
mortality. Therapeutic strategies include synthetic drugs and surgery, which
may entail high costs and serious complications. Plant-based medicinal agents
offer an alternative approach. A review of the studies on accessible botanical
sources for the treatment of obesity is provided, which attempts to explain how
these medicinal plants act to cause weight loss, and which approach is safer
and more efficient. Information was gathered for the period of 1991 to 2012.
Five basic mechanisms, including stimulating thermogenesis, lowering
lipogenesis, enhancing lipolysis, suppressing appetite, and decreasing the
absorption of lipids may be operating. Consumption of standardized medicinal
plant extracts may be a safe treatment for obesity. However, some combinations
of medicinal plants may result in either lower efficacy or cause unexpected
side-effects.

    <title>DNA sequencing and predictions of the cosmic theory of life</title>
    <summary>  The theory of cometary panspermia, developed by the late Sir Fred Hoyle and
the present author argues that life originated cosmically as a unique event in
one of a great multitude of comets or planetary bodies in the Universe. Life on
Earth did not originate here but was introduced by impacting comets, and its
further evolution was driven by the subsequent acquisition of cosmically
derived genes. Explicit predictions of this theory published in 1979-1981,
stating how the acquisition of new genes drives evolution, are compared with
recent developments in relation to horizontal gene transfer, and the role of
retroviruses in evolution. Precisely-stated predictions of the theory of
cometary panspermia are shown to have been verified.

    <summary>  Glycerol titration distinguished from free water the local hydration shell
involved in ATPase transition from active to inactive, with cooperativity for
water n=16. Rat brain cortex: NE-stimulated and its basal AC in the absence of
free Mg2+, allows a refractive state of AC with negative cooperativity for
MgATP and ATP4-. The erythrocyte-Hb system operates as a metabolic sensor to
match glucose availability with the release of Hb-carried, O2 and Mg2+ at CSF.
[Mg(H2O)6](H2O)122+ by chelating either a protein or ATP4- losses most of its
hydration shell. The ion pump ATPase by forming ADP3- releases an incompletely
hydrated Mg2+, which could capture H2O from either [Na.(H2O)6]+ or [K.(H2O)6]+.
Thus, sieve-sizing their hydration shells for fitting into Na+-pump channels.
An AC refractory period may participate in STM. Mg2+ with cooperativity n=3.7
activates NE-AC. CREB-generated receptors coupled by Mg2+ may modulate
hydration shells-dependent oscillations for retrieval of LTM

    <title>Affine invariance of human hand movements: a direct test</title>
    <summary>  Geometrical invariance, in particular affine invariance, has been recently
proposed as an important principle underlying the production of hand movements.
However, tests of affine invariance have traditionally been applied to the
consequences of this principle rather to the principle itself. Here, we
designed and performed an original, direct, test of affine invariance in a
scribbling experiment. In each of the 10800 pairs of randomly-selected
scribbling segments, we compared the time parameterizations obtained by
transforming the first segment using four different transportation rules -
affine, equi-affine, Euclidian and constant - with the experimentally-observed
parameterization of the second segment. We observed that, when the two paths
are affinely-similar, the affine transportation of the first segment yields the
time parameterization that best matches the experimental parameterization of
the second segment, which directly demonstrates the existence of affine
invariance in the production of hand movements.

    <title>Field theory approach in the dynamics of biomatter</title>
    <summary>  A new approach to model the biomatter dynamics based on the field theory is
presented. It is shown that some well known tools in field theory can be
utilized to describe the physical phenomena in life matters, in particular at
elementary biomatters like DNA and proteins. In this approach, the biomatter
dynamics are represented as results of interactions among its elementary
matters in the form of lagrangian. Starting from the lagrangian would provide
stronger underlying theoretical consideration for further extension. Moreover,
it also enables us to acquire rich physical observables using statistical
mechanics instead of relying on the space-time dynamics from certain equation
of motions which is not solvable due to its nonlinearities. Few examples from
previous results are given and explained briefly.

    <title>A Broader Perspective about Organization and Coherence in Biological
  Systems</title>
    <summary>  The implications of large-scale coherence in biological systems and possible
links to quantum theory are only beginning to be explored. Whether quantum-like
coherent phenomena are relevant, or even possible at all, at the high
temperatures of biological systems remains unsettled. Here, we present a
broader perspective on biological organization and how quantum-like dynamics
and coherence might shape the very fabric from which complex biological systems
are organized. Regardless of its exact nature, a unique form of coherence seems
apparent at multiple scales in biology and its better characterization may have
broad consequences for the understanding of living organisms as complex
systems.

    <title>The three different phases in the dynamics of chemical reaction networks
  and their relationship to cancer</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the catalytic reactions model used in cell modeling. The
reaction kinetic is defined through the energies of different species of
molecules following random independent distribution. The related statistical
physics model has three phases and these three phases emerged in the dynamics:
fast dynamics phase, slow dynamic phase and ultra-slow dynamic phase. The
phenomenon we found is a rather general, does not depend on the details of the
model. We assume as a hypothesis that the transition between these phases
(glassiness degrees) is related to cancer. The imbalance in the rate of
processes between key aspects of the cell (gene regulation, protein-protein
interaction, metabolical networks) creates a change in the fine tuning between
these key aspects, affects the logics of the cell and initiates cancer. It is
probable that cancer is a change of phase resulting from increased and
deregulated metabolic reactions.

    <title>Human anaerobic intestinal "rope" parasites</title>
    <summary>  Human intestinal helminths are described in this paper. They can be over a
meter long, with an irregular cylindrical shape, resembling a rope. These
anaerobic intestinal "rope" parasites differ significantly from other
well-known intestinal parasites. Rope parasites can leave human body with
enemas, and are often mistaken for intestinal lining, feces, or decayed remains
of other parasites. Rope parasites can attach to intestinal walls with suction
bubbles, which later develop into suction heads. Walls of the rope parasites
consist of scale-like cells forming multiple branched channels along the
parasite's length. Rope parasites can move by jet propulsion, passing gas
bubbles through these channels. Currently known antihelminthic methods include
special enemas. Most humans are likely hosting these helminths.

    <title>Development stages of the "rope" human intestinal parasite</title>
    <summary>  This paper describes the five development stages of the rope worm, which
could be human parasite. Rope worms have been discovered as a result of
cleansing enemas. Thousands or people have passed the rope worms from all over
the World. Adult stages live in human gastro-intestinal tract and are
anaerobic. They move inside the body by releasing gas bubbles utilizing jet
propulsion. These worms look like a rope, and can be over a meter long. The
development stages were identified based on their morphology. The fifth stage
looks like a tough string of mucus about a meter long. The fourth stage looks
similar, but the rope worm is shorter and has softer slimier body. The third
stage looks like branched jellyfish. The second stage is viscous snot, or mucus
with visible gas bubbles that act as suction cups. The first stage is slimier
mucus with fewer bubbles, which can reside almost anywhere in the body. Rope
worms have cellular structure, based on optical microscopy, DAPI staining and
DNA analysis, however, the data collected is not sufficient to identify the
specie. Removal methods are also mentioned in the paper.

    <title>Predicting growth and finding biomass production using the general
  growth mechanism</title>
    <summary>  First, we briefly describe the general growth mechanism, which governs the
growth of living organisms, and its mathematical representation, the growth
equation. Using the growth equation, we compute growth curve for S. cerevisiae
and show that it corresponds to available experimental data. Then, we propose a
new method for finding amount of synthesized biomass without complicated
stoichiometric computations and apply this method to evaluation of biomass
production by S. cerevisiae. We found that obtained results are very close to
values obtained by methods of metabolic flux analysis. Since methods of
metabolic flux analysis require finding produced biomass, which is one of the
most important parameters affecting stoichiometric models, a priori knowledge
of produced biomass can significantly improve methods of metabolic flux
analysis in many aspects, which we also discuss. Besides, based on the general
growth mechanism, we considered evolutionary development of S. cerevisiae and
found that it is a more ancient organism than S. pombe and is apparently its
direct predecessor.

    <summary>  Results of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, Triple Oxygen Isotope analysis
and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies are presented for stone
fragments recovered from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka following a
witnessed fireball event on 29 December 2012. The existence of numerous
nitrogen depleted highly carbonaceous fossilized biological structures fused
into the rock matrix is inconsistent with recent terrestrial contamination.
Oxygen isotope results compare well with those of CI and CI-like chondrites but
are inconsistent with the fulgurite hypothesis.

    <title>Fossil diatoms in a new carbonaceous meteorite</title>
    <summary>  We report the discovery for the first time of diatom frustules in a
carbonaceous meteorite that fell in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka on
29 December 2012. Contamination is excluded by the circumstance that the
elemental abundances within the structures match closely with those of the
surrounding matrix. There is also evidence of structures morphologically
similar to red rain cells that may have contributed to the episode of red rain
that followed within days of the meteorite fall. The new data on fossil diatoms
provide strong evidence to support the theory of cometary panspermia.

    <title>Sine-Gordon Solitons, Kinks and Breathers as Physical Models of
  Nonlinear Excitations in Living Cellular Structures</title>
    <summary>  Nonlinear space-time dynamics, defined in terms of celebrated 'solitonic'
equations, brings indispensable tools for understanding, prediction and control
of complex behaviors in both physical and life sciences. In this paper, we
review sine-Gordon solitons, kinks and breathers as models of nonlinear
excitations in complex systems in physics and in living cellular structures,
both intra-cellular (DNA, protein folding and microtubules) and inter-cellular
(neural impulses and muscular contractions).
  Key words: Sine-Gordon solitons, kinks and breathers, DNA, Protein folding,

    <title>Harmonic mean as a determinant of the genetic code</title>
    <summary>  It is shown that there is a sense in splitting Genetic Code Table (GCT) into
three parts using the harmonic mean, calculated by the formula H (a, b) = 2ab /
(a + b), where a = 63 and b = 31.5. Within these three parts, the amino acids
(AAs) are positioned on the basis of the validity of the evident regularities
of key parameters, such as polarity, hydrophobicity and enzyme-mediated amino
acid classification. In addition, there are obvious balances of the number of
atoms in the nucleotide triplets and corresponding amino acid groups and/or
classes.

    <title>Agreeing to disagree, some ironies, disappointing scientific practice
  and a call for better: reply to &lt;&lt;The poor performance of TMM on

    <summary>  This letter is a response to a Divergent Views article entitled &lt;&lt;The poor
performance of TMM on microRNA-Seq&gt;&gt; (Garmire and Subramaniam 2013), which was
a response to our Divergent Views article entitled &lt;&lt;miRNA-seq normalization
comparisons need improvement&gt;&gt; (Zhou et al. 2013). Using reproducible code
examples, we showed that they incorrectly used our normalization method and
highlighted additional concerns with their study. Here, I wish to debunk
several untrue or misleading statements made by the authors (hereafter referred
to as GS) in their response. Unlike GSs, my claims are supported by R code,
citations and email correspondences. I finish by making a call for better
practice.

    <title>The Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection Controls</title>
    <summary>  Multi-resistant organisms (MROs), the bacteria that are resistant to a number
of different antibiotics, have been very popular around the world in recent
years. They are very difficult to treat but highly infectious in humans. MRSA
(Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) is one of the MROs. It is
believed that in 2007 more people died of MRSA than of AIDS worldwide. In
Australia "there are about 2000 people per year who have a bloodstream
infection with the MRSA germ and the vast majority of those get them from
health care procedure" (Nader, 2005). It is acknowledged as a significant
challenge to Australian hospitals for MRSA infection control. Nursing
professionals are in urgent need of the study of MRSA nosocomial infection
controls. This review provides insight into the hand washing and isolation
infection-control strategies for MRSA. The important technologies on those two
aspects worldwide are well surveyed, compared, contrasted, and discussed. The
review is to do a complete survey on the hand washing and isolation
technologies of infection controls for MRSA and try to provide some possible
recommendations for Australian hospitals.

    <title>Association between Experiences and Representations: Memory, Dreaming,
  Dementia and Consciousness</title>
    <summary>  The mechanisms underlying major aspects of the human brain remain a mystery.
It is unknown how verbal episodic memory is formed and integrated with sensory
episodic memory. There is no consensus on the function and nature of dreaming.
Here we present a theory for governing neural activity in the human brain. The
theory describes the mechanisms for building memory traces for entities and
explains how verbal memory is integrated with sensory memory. We infer that a
core function of dreaming is to move charged particles such as calcium ions
from the hippocampus to association areas to primary areas. We link a high
level of calcium ions concentrations to Alzheimer's disease. We present a more
precise definition of consciousness. Our results are a step forward in
understanding the function and health of the human brain and provide the public
with ways to keep a healthy brain.

    <title>Genetic information, physical interpreters and thermodynamics; the
  material-informatic basis of biosemiosis</title>
    <summary>  The sequence of nucleotide bases occurring in an organism's DNA is often
regarded as a codescript for its construction. However, information in a DNA
sequence can only be regarded as a codescript relative to an operational
biochemical machine, which the information constrains in such a way as to
direct the process of construction. In reality, any biochemical machine for
which a DNA codescript is efficacious is itself produced through the mechanical
interpretation of an identical or very similar codescript. In these terms the
origin of life can be described as a bootstrap process involving the
simultaneous accumulation of genetic information and the generation of a
machine that interprets it as instructions for its own construction. This
problem is discussed within the theoretical frameworks of thermodynamics,
informatics and self-reproducing automata, paying special attention to the
physico-chemical origin of genetic coding and the conditions, both
thermodynamic and informatic, which a system must fulfil in order for it to
sustain semiosis. The origin of life is equated with biosemiosis

    <title>The matrix method of representation, analysis and classification of long
  genetic sequences</title>
    <summary>  The article is devoted to a matrix method of comparative analysis of long
nucleotide sequences by means of a presentation of each sequence in a form of
three digital binary sequences. This method uses biochemical attributes of
nucleotides and it also uses a possibility of presentation of every whole set
of n-mers in a form of one of members of a Kronecker family of genetic
matrices. Due to this method, a long nucleotide sequence can be visually
represented as an individual fractal-like mosaic or another regular mosaic of
binary type. In contrast to natural nucleotide sequences, artificial random
sequences give non-regular patterns. Examples of binary mosaics of long
nucleotide sequences are shown, including cases of human chromosomes and
penicillins. Interpretation of binary presentations of nucleotide sequences
from the point of view of Gray code is also tested. Possible reasons of genetic
meaning of Kronecker multiplication of matrices are analyzed. The received
results are discussed.

    <title>The age specific incidence anomaly suggests that cancers originate
  during development</title>
    <summary>  Cancers are caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations. Since this
accumulation takes time, the incidence of most cancers is thought to increase
exponentially with age. However, careful measurements of the age-specific
incidence shows that the specific incidence for many forms of cancer rises with
age to a maximum, then decreases. This decrease in the age-specific incidence
with age is an anomaly. Understanding this anomaly should lead to a better
understanding of how tumors develop and grow. Here I derive the shape of the
age-specific incidence, showing that it should follow the shape of a Weibull
distribution. Measurements indicate that the age-specific incidence for colon
cancer does indeed follow a Weibull distribution. This analysis leads to the
interpretation that for colon cancer two sub-populations exist in the general
population: a susceptible population and an immune population. Colon tumors
will only occur in the susceptible population. This analysis is consistent with
the developmental origins of disease hypothesis and generalizable to many other
common forms of cancer.

    <title>Dynamic DNA Processing: A Microcode Model of Cell Differentiation</title>
    <summary>  A general theoretical framework is put forth to organize and understand
various observed phenomena and mathematical relationships in the field of
molecular biology. By modeling each cell in eukaryotic organisms as a processor
having a unique set of allowed states, represented by a specific DNA sequence,
we demonstrate a method by which gene expression can be regulated. As the
theory is developed, we suggest reasons for the complementary, quaternary
(4-base) coding scheme used in most eukaryotes. A role for transposable
elements is suggested, as is a role for the abundance of noncoding DNA, along
with a clearly-defined method by which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's)
may alter gene expression. The effect of various errors is considered. Finally,
a mechanism for inter-processor communication is proposed to explain cell-cell
recognition processes, which leads to an elucidation of a possible pathway by
which nonmutagenic carcinogenic agents may act.

    <title>Correlation of multiple sclerosis incidence in the UK 1990-2010 with
  geomagnetic disturbances</title>
    <summary>  Recently, Mackenzie et al. reported incidence and prevalence of multiple
sclerosis (MS) in the UK from 1990-2010. Authors of this report indicated that
they could not explain the cause of decreasing MS incidence trend in the UK
during this time period. Such inability mainly resulted from the fact that
often-cited hypotheses of MS, such as vitamin D deficiency hypothesis, cannot
provide any answer for MS incidence trends. However, the newly proposed
hypothesis of MS that is based on the biological effects of geomagnetic
disturbances (GMD) has the ability to provide explanations for this observed
trend. In this commentary, we showed that there is a significant correlation
among alterations in GMD with changes in MS incidence and explained how
researchers can use GMD hypothesis to evaluate such relations. Moreover, we
clarified why we need a revision in the method of reporting MS incidence data
to find actual environmental factor of MS.

    <title>Parkinson disease is a TH17 dominant autoimmune disorder against
  accumulated alpha-synuclein</title>
    <summary>  Parkinson disease is a very common neurodegenerative disorder. Patients
usually undergo destruction of substantia nigra to develop typical symptoms
such as resting tremor, hypokinesia, and rigidity. However, the exact mechanism
of Parkinson disease is still unknown, so it is called idiopathic Parkinsonism.
According to my microarray analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and
substantia nigra brain tissue, I propose that Parkinson disease is actually a
TH17 dominant autoimmune disease. Based on the microarray data in substantia
nigra, HSP40, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, HSP105, TLR5, TLR7, CEBPB, CEBPG, FOS, and
caspase1 are significantly up-regulated. In peripheral leukocytes, NFKB1A,
CEBPD, FOS, retinoic receptor alpha, suppressor of IKK epsilon, S100A11, G-CSF,
MMP9, IL-1 receptor, IL-8 receptor, TNF receptor, caspase8, c1q receptor,
cathepsin Z, HLA-G, complement receptor1, and complement 5a receptor. General
immune related genes are also up-regulated including ILF2, CD22, CD3E, BLNK,
ILF3, TCR alpha, TCR zeta, TCR delta, LAT, ITK, Ly9, and BANK1. The autoantigen
is mainly alpha-synuclein. After knowing the exact disease pathophysiology, we
can develop better drugs to prevent or control the detrimental disorder.

    <title>A probabilistic model to describe the dual phenomena of biochemical
  pathway damage and biochemical pathway repair</title>
    <summary>  Biochemical pathways emerge from a series of Brownian collisions between
various types of biological macromolecules within separate cellular
compartments and in highly viscous cytosol. Functioning of biochemical networks
suggests that such serendipitous collisions, as a whole, result into a perfect
synchronous order. Nonetheless, owing to the very nature of Brownian
collisions, a small yet non-trivial probability can always be associated with
the events when such synchronizations fail to emerge consistently; which
account for a damage of a biochemical pathway. The repair mechanism of the
system then attempts to minimize the damage, in the pursuit to bring restore
the appropriate level of synchronization between reactant concentrations.
Present work presents a predictive probabilistic model that describes the
various facets of this complicated and coupled process(damaging and repairing).
By describing the cytosolic reality of Brownian collisions with
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, the model presents analytical answers to the
questions, with what probability a fragment of any pathway may suffer damage
within an arbitrary interval of time? and with what probability the damage to a
pathway can be repaired within any arbitrary interval of time?

    <title>Conception of Biologic System: Basis Functional Elements and Metric
  Properties</title>
    <summary>  A notion of biologic system or just a system implies a functional wholeness
of comprising system components. Positive and negative feedback are the
examples of how the idea to unite anatomical elements in the whole functional
structure was successfully used in practice to explain regulatory mechanisms in
biology and medicine. There are numerous examples of functional and metabolic
pathways which are not regulated by feedback loops and have a structure of
reciprocal relationships. Expressed in the matrix form positive feedback,
negative feedback, and reciprocal links represent three basis elements of a Lie
algebra sl(2,R)of a special linear group SL(2,R). It is proposed that the
mathematical group structure can be realized through the three regulatory
elements playing a role of a functional basis of biologic systems. The
structure of the basis elements endows the space of biological variables with
indefinite metric. Metric structure resembles Minkowski's space-time (+, -, -)
making the carrier spaces of biologic variables and the space of
transformations inhomogeneous. It endows biologic systems with a rich
functional structure, giving the regulatory elements special differentiating
features to form steady autonomous subsystems reducible to one-dimensional
components.

    <title>The genetic code invariance: when Euler and Fibonacci meet</title>
    <summary>  The number of atoms in the four ribonucleotides uridine monophosphate,
cytidine monophosphate, adenine monophosphate and guanine monophosphate is
taken as a key parameter. A mathematical relation describing the condensation
of the three basic subunits a nucleobase, a ribose and a phosphate group, to
form a ribonucleotide, is first obtained from this parameter. Next, the use of
the latter and Euler totient function is shown to lead to the atom number
content of the 64 codons and also to Rakocevic pattern. Finally, selected
finite sums of Fibonacci numbers are shown to lead to the nucleon number
content of the amino acids in various degeneracy patterns, and also to the
multiplet structure of the 20 amino acids as well as to the degeneracy.

    <title>Information -sharing, adaptive epigenetics and human longevity</title>
    <summary>  Emerging empirical and theoretical thinking about human aging places
considerable value upon the role of the environment as a major factor which can
promote prolonged healthy longevity. Our contemporary, information-rich
environment is taken to mean not merely the actual physical surroundings of a
person but it is also considered in a more abstract sense, to denote cultural,
societal and technological influences. Our modern environment is far from being
static or stable. In fact, it is continually changing in an exponential manner,
necessitating constant adaptive responses on behalf of our developmental and
evolutionary mechanisms. In this paper, I attempt to describe how a continual,
balanced and meaningful exposure to a stimulating environment, including
exposure to information-that-requires-action (but NOT trivial information), has
direct or indirect repercussions on epigenetic mechanisms which may then act to
prolong healthy longevity. Information gained from our environment acts as a
hormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,
eventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage. The consequence of
this biological information-processing mechanism may influence resource
allocation and redress the imbalance between somatic cell versus germ-line cell
repairs. This can eventually have evolutionary consequences resulting in the
drastic reduction of age-related disease and degeneration.

    <title>Starvation of Cancer via Induced Ketogenesis and Severe Hypoglycemia</title>
    <summary>  Neoplasms are highly dependent on glucose as their substrate for energy
production and are generally not able to catabolize other fuel sources such as
ketones and fatty acids. Thus, removing access to glucose has the potential to
starve cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Unfortunately, other body tissues are
also dependent on glucose for energy under normal conditions. However, in human
starvation (or in the setting of diet-induced ketogenesis), the body
"keto-adapts" and glucose requirements of most tissues drop to almost nil.
Exceptions include the central nervous system (CNS) and various other tissues
which have a small but obligatory requirement of glucose. Our hypothesized
treatment takes keto-adaptation as a prerequisite. We then propose the
induction of severe hypoglycemia by depressing gluconeogenesis while
administering glucose to the brain. Although severe hypoglycemia normally
produces adverse effects such as seizure and coma, it is relatively safe
following ketoadaptation. We hypothesize that our therapeutic hypoglycemia
treatment has potential to rapidly induce tumor cell necrosis.

    <title>Accounting for the 'network' in the Natura 2000 network: A response to
  Hochkirch et al. 2013</title>
    <summary>  Worldwide, we are experiencing an unprecedented, accelerated loss of
biodiversity triggered by a bundle of anthropogenic threats such as habitat
destruction, environmental pollution and climate change. Despite all efforts of
the European biodiversity conservation policy, initiated 20 years ago by the
Habitats Directive that provided the legal basis for establishing the Natura
2000 network, the goal to halt the decline of biodiversity in Europe by 2010
has been missed. Hochkirch et al. (2013, Conserv. Lett. 6: 462-467) identified
four major shortcomings of the current implementation of the directive
concerning prioritization of the annexes, conservation plans, survey systems
and financial resources. However they did not account for the intended network
character of the Natura 2000 sites, an aspect of highest relevance. This
response letter deals with this shortcoming as it is the prerequisite, over any
other strategies, ensuring a Natura 2020 network being worth its name.

    <title>Ising model description of long range correlations in DNA sequences</title>
    <summary>  We model long range correlations of nucleotides in the human DNA sequence
using the long range one dimensional Ising model. We show that for distances
between $10^3$ and $10^6$ bp the correlations show an universal behaviour and
may be described by the non-mean field limit of the long range 1d Ising model.
This allows us to make some testable hypothesis on the nature of the
interaction between distant portions of the DNA chain which led to the DNA
structure that we observe today in higher eukaryotes.

    <title>Geometry of Morphogenesis</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a formalism for the geometry of eukaryotic cells and
organisms.Cells are taken to be star-convex with good biological reason. This
allows for a convenient description of their extent in space as well as all
manner of cell surface gradients. We assume that a spectrum of such cell
surface markers determines an epigenetic code for organism shape. The union of
cells in space at a moment in time is by definition the organism taken as a
metric subspace of Euclidean space, which can be further equipped with an
arbitrary measure. Each cell determines a point in space thus assigning a
finite configuration of distinct points in space to an organism, and a bundle
over this configuration space is introduced with fiber a Hilbert space
recording specific epigenetic data. On this bundle, a Lagrangian formulation of
morphogenetic dynamics is proposed based on Gromov-Hausdorff distance which at
once describes both embryo development and regenerative growth.

    <title>A Model on Genome Evolution</title>
    <summary>  A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on three assumptions the
evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. The general law on the direction
of genome evolution is given. Both the deterministic classical equation and the
stochastic quantum equation are proposed. It is proved that the classical
equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can
be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The
wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced
logically. It is shown that the classical trajectory is a limiting case of the
general quantum evolution depicted in the coarse-grained time. The observed
smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the
classical and quantum phases. The speciation event is explained by the quantum
transition in quantum phase. Fundamental constants of time dimension, the
quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for
characterizing the genome evolution. The size of minimum genome is deduced from
the quantum uncertainty lower bound. The present work shows the quantum law may
be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic
physics, but also in genome evolution.

    <title>Entropy and long-range correlations in DNA sequences</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the structure of DNA molecules of different organisms by using the
additive Markov chain approach. Transforming nucleotide sequences into binary
strings, we perform statistical analysis of the corresponding "texts". We
develop the theory of N-step additive binary stationary ergodic Markov chains
and analyze their differential entropy. Supposing that the correlations are
weak we express the conditional probability function of the chain by means of
the pair correlation function and represent the entropy as a functional of the
pair correlator. Since the model uses two point correlators instead of
probability of block occurring, it makes possible to calculate the entropy of
subsequences at much longer distances than with the use of the standard
methods. We utilize the obtained analytical result for numerical evaluation of
the entropy of coarse-grained DNA texts. We believe that the entropy study can
be used for biological classification of living species.

    <title>Native American Flute Ergonomics</title>
    <summary>  This study surveyed ergonomic issues in 308 Native American flute players. It
also correlated the physical measurements of a subgroup of 33 participants with
the largest flute they found comfortable. The data was used to derive a
predictive formula for the largest comfortable flute based on physical
measurements. The median age of players was 63 years with a mean of 6.9 years
playing Native American flute. Females reported significantly less time playing
the instrument (p = .004), but significantly faster self-reported progress
rates (p = .001). Physical discomfort was experienced by 47-64% of players at
least some of the time. Over 10% of players reported moderate discomfort on an
average basis. Females report significantly higher maximum and average physical
discomfort than males (p &lt; .001 and p = .015, respectively). Height, arm span,
hand span, and reported length of time playing and experience level all
correlated with the largest flute that the player found comfortable.
Multivariate coefficient analysis on those factors yielded a formula with a
strong correlation to the largest comfortable flute (r = +.650). However, the
formula does not have sufficient correlation to have value in predicting flute
design. Customization of Native American flutes with the goal of improving
ergonomics is proposed as a worthwhile goal.

    <title>Transduction of DNA information through water and electromagnetic waves</title>
    <summary>  The experimental conditions by which electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low
frequency can be emitted by diluted aqueous solutions of some bacterial and
viral DNAs are described. That the recorded EMS and nanostructures induced in
water carry the DNA information (sequence) is shown by retrieval of that same
DNA by classical PCR amplification using the TAQ polymerase, including both
primers and nucleotides. Moreover, such a transduction process has also been
observed in living human cells exposed to EMS irradiation. These experiments
suggest that coherent long range molecular interaction must be at work in water
so to allow the observed features. The quantum field theory analysis of the
phenomenon is presented.

    <summary>  Heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) has been proposed as a marker for
depressive symptoms and other aspects of mental health. However, the real
correlation between them is presently uncertain, as previous studies have
generally been conducted on the basis of small samples. In a sample of 113
adult male prisoners, we analyzed correlations between five measures of HR/HRV
and five psychological measures of mental health aspects (depression, state and
trait anxiety, and social relationships). We used Nadaraya-Watson
non-parametric regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman
correlation to detect possible relations. Despite strong correlations among
HR/HRV measures and among psychological measures, correlations between HR/HRV
and psychological measures were low and non-significant for the overall sample.
However, we found an age dependency, suggesting some correlations in younger
people (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52; both p &lt;
.005). Overall, the general utility of HR/HRV as a marker for mental health
across populations remains unclear. Future research should address age and
other potential confounders more consistently.

    <title>Comment on Activation of Visual Pigments by Light and Heat (Science 332,
  1307-312, 2011)</title>
    <summary>  It is known that the Arrhenius equation, based on the Boltzmann distribution,
can model only a part (e.g. half of the activation energy) for retinal discrete
dark noise observed for vertebrate rod and cone pigments. Luo et al (Science,
332, 1307-312, 2011) presented a new approach to explain this discrepancy by
showing that applying the Hinshelwood distribution instead the Boltzmann
distribution in the Arrhenius equation solves the problem successfully.
However, a careful reanalysis of the methodology and results shows that the
approach of Luo et al is questionable and the results found do not solve the
problem completely.

    <title>Heterogeneity of cells may explain allometric scaling of metabolic rate</title>
    <summary>  The origin of allometric scaling of metabolic rate is a long-standing
question in biology. Several models have been proposed for explaining the
origin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,
previous models only demonstrate either two important observations for the
allometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of
3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this
study, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that
total surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two
observations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic
rate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both
theoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law
although several different biological strategies are considered. The model
validity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the
importance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric
scaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the
origin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of
the model.

    <title>Potential of volatile organic compounds as markers of entrapped humans
  for use in urban search-and-rescue operations</title>
    <summary>  Volatile organic compounds emitted by a human body form a chemical signature
capable of providing invaluable information on the physiological status of an
individual and, thereby, could serve as signs-of-life for detecting victims
after natural or man-made disasters. In this review a database of potential
biomarkers of human presence was created on the basis of existing literature
reports on volatiles in human breath, skin emanation, blood, and urine.
Approximate fluxes of these species from the human body were estimated and used
to predict their concentrations in the vicinity of victims. The proposed
markers were classified into groups of different potential for victim
detection. The major classification discriminants were the capability of
detection by portable, real-time analytical instruments and background levels
in urban environment. The data summarized in this review are intended to assist
studies on the detection of humans via chemical analysis and accelerate
investigations in this area of knowledge.

    <title>Similarity Is Not Enough: Tipping Points of Ebola Zaire Mortalities</title>
    <summary>  In early 2014 an outbreak of a slightly mutated Zaire Ebola subtype appeared
in West Africa which is less virulent than 1976 and 1994 strains. The numbers
of cases per year appear to be ~ 1000 times larger than the earlier strains,
suggesting a greatly enhanced transmissibility. Although the fraction of the
2014 spike glycoprotein mutations is very small (~3%), the mortality is
significantly reduced, while the transmission appears to have increased
strongly. Bioinformatic scaling had previously shown similar inversely
correlated trends in virulence and transmission in N1 (H1N1) and N2 (H3N2)
influenza spike glycoprotein mutations. These trends appear to be related to
various external factors (migration, availability of pure water, and
vaccination programs). The molecular mechanisms for Ebola's mutational response
involve mainly changes in the disordered mucin-like domain (MLD) of its spike
glycoprotein amino acids. The MLD has been observed to form the tip of an
oligomeric amphiphilic wedge that selectively pries apart cell-cell interfaces
via an oxidative mechanism.

    <title>Genomic Imaging Based on Codongrams and a^2grams</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces new tools for genomic signal processing, which can
assist for genomic attribute extracting or describing biologically meaningful
features embedded in a DNA. The codongrams and a2grams are offered as an
alternative to spectrograms and scalograms. Twenty different a^2grams are
defined for a genome, one for each amino acid (valgram is an a^2gram for
valine; alagram is an a^2gram for alanine and so on). They provide information
about the distribution and occurrence of the investigated amino acid. In
particular, the metgram can be used to find out potential start position of
genes within a genome. This approach can help implementing a new diagnosis test
for genetic diseases by providing a type of DNA-medical imaging.

    <title>The Genetic Code revisited: Inner-to-outer map, 2D-Gray map, and
  World-map Genetic Representations</title>
    <summary>  How to represent the genetic code? Despite the fact that it is extensively
known, the DNA mapping into proteins remains as one of the relevant discoveries
of genetics. However, modern genomic signal processing usually requires
converting symbolic-DNA strings into complex-valued signals in order to take
full advantage of a broad variety of digital processing techniques. The genetic
code is revisited in this paper, addressing alternative representations for it,
which can be worthy for genomic signal processing. Three original
representations are discussed. The inner-to-outer map builds on the unbalanced
role of nucleotides of a 'codon' and it seems to be suitable for handling
information-theory-based matter. The two-dimensional-Gray map representation is
offered as a mathematically structured map that can help interpreting
spectrograms or scalograms. Finally, the world-map representation for the
genetic code is investigated, which can particularly be valuable for
educational purposes -besides furnishing plenty of room for application of
distance-based algorithms.

    <title>Taylor's power law: before and after 50 years of scientific scrutiny</title>
    <summary>  Taylor's power law is one of the mostly widely known empirical patterns in
ecology discovered in the 20th century. It states that the variance of species
population density scales as a power-law function of the mean population
density. Taylor's power law was named after the British ecologist Lionel Roy
Taylor. During the past half-century, Taylor's power law was confirmed for
thousands of biological species and even for non-biological quantities.
Numerous theories and models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of
Taylor's power law. However an understanding of the historical origin of this
ubiquitous scaling pattern is lacking. This work reviews two research aspects
that are fundamental to the discovery of Taylor's power law and provides an
outlook of its future studies.

    <title>Bessel Functions in Mass Action. Modeling of Memories and Remembrances</title>
    <summary>  Data from experimental observations of a class of neurological processes
(Freeman K-sets) present functional distribution reproducing Bessel function
behavior. We model such processes with couples of damped/amplified oscillators
which provide time dependent representation of Bessel equation. The root loci
of poles and zeros conform to solutions of K-sets. Some light is shed on the
problem of filling the gap between the cellular level dynamics and the brain
functional activity. Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is related with the
cortex thermodynamic features. This provides a possible mechanism to deduce
lifetime of recorded memory.

    <title>TOPO: Improving remote homologue recognition via identifying common
  protein structure framework</title>
    <summary>  Protein structure prediction remains a challenge in the field of
computational biology. Traditional protein structure prediction approaches
include template-based modelling (say, homology modelling, and threading), and
ab initio. A threading algorithm takes a query protein sequence as input,
recognizes the most likely fold, and finally reports the alignments of the
query sequence to structure-known templates as output. The existing threading
approaches mainly utilizes the information of protein sequence profile, solvent
accessibility, contact probability, etc., and correctly recognize folds for
some proteins. However, the existing threading approaches show poorly
performance for remote homology proteins. How to improve the fold recognition
for remote homology proteins remains to be a difficult task for protein
structure prediction.

    <title>Molecular geometry of alkaloids present in seeds of mexican prickly
  poppy</title>
    <summary>  The work is a study of the geometry of the molecules via molecular mechanics
of the main alkaloids found in the seeds of Argemone Mexicana Linn, a prickly
poppy, which is considered one of the most important species of plants in
traditional Mexican and Indian medicine system. The seeds have toxic properties
as well as bactericide, hallucinogenic, fungicide, insecticide, in
isoquinolines and sanguinarine alkaloids such as berberine. A computational
study of the molecular geometry of the molecules through molecular mechanics of
the main alkaloids compounds present in plant seeds is described in a computer
simulation. The plant has active ingredients compounds: allocryptopine,
berberine, chelerythrine, copsitine, dihydrosanguinarine, protopine and
sanguinarine. The studied alkaloids form two groups having similar charge
distribution among themselves, which have dipole moments of these two times
higher than in the other group.

    <title>Vaccine escape in 2013-4 and the hydropathic evolution of glycoproteins
  of A/H3N2 viruses</title>
    <summary>  More virulent strains of influenza virus subtypes H1N1 appeared widely in
2007 and H3N2 in 2011, and especially 2013-4, when the effectiveness of the
H3N2 vaccine decreased nearly to zero. The amino acid differences of
neuraminidase from prior less virulent strains appear to be small (&lt;1%) when
tabulated through sequence alignments and counting site identities and
similarities. Here we show how analyzing fractal hydropathic forces responsible
for neuraminidase globular compaction and modularity quantifies the mutational
origins of increased virulence. It also predicts vaccine escape and specifies
optimized targets for the 2015 H3N2 vaccine different from the WHO target.
Unlike some earlier methods based on measuring hemagglutinin antigenic drift
and ferret sera, which take several years, cover only a few candidate strains,
and are ambiguous, the new methods are timely and can be completed, using NCBI
and GISAID amino acid sequences only, in a few days.

    <title>Accelerating Scientific Publication in Biology</title>
    <summary>  Scientific publications enable results and ideas to be transmitted throughout
the scientific community. The number and type of journal publications also have
become the primary criteria used in evaluating career advancement. Our analysis
suggests that publication practices have changed considerably in the life
sciences over the past thirty years. More experimental data is now required for
publication, and the average time required for graduate students to publish
their first paper has increased and is approaching the desirable duration of
Ph.D. training. Since publication is generally a requirement for career
progression, schemes to reduce the time of graduate student and postdoctoral
training may be difficult to implement without also considering new mechanisms
for accelerating communication of their work. The increasing time to
publication also delays potential catalytic effects that ensue when many
scientists have access to new information. The time has come for life
scientists, funding agencies, and publishers to discuss how to communicate new
findings in a way that best serves the interests of the public and the
scientific community.

    <title>The species problem and its logic: Inescapable Ambiguity and
  Framework-relativity</title>
    <summary>  For more than fifty years, taxonomists have proposed numerous alternative
definitions of species while they searched for a unique, comprehensive, and
persuasive definition. This monograph shows that these efforts have been
unnecessary, and indeed have provably been a pursuit of a will o' the wisp
because they have failed to recognize the theoretical impossibility of what
they seek to accomplish. A clear and rigorous understanding of the logic
underlying species definition leads both to a recognition of the inescapable
ambiguity that affects the definition of species, and to a framework-relative
approach to species definition that is logically compelling, i.e., cannot not
be accepted without inconsistency. An appendix reflects upon the conclusions
reached, applying them in an intellectually whimsical taxonomic thought
experiment that conjectures the possibility of an emerging new human species.

    <title>Understanding of Genetic Code Degeneracy and New Way of Classifying of
  Protein Family: A Mathematical Approach</title>
    <summary>  The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded in genetic
material (DNA or RNA sequences) is translated into proteins (amino acid
sequences) by living cells. The code defines a mapping between tri-nucleotide
sequences, called codons, and amino acids. Since there are 20 amino acids and
64 possible tri-nucleotide sequences, more than one among these 64 triplets can
code for a single amino acid which incorporates the problem of degeneracy. This
manuscript explains the underlying logic of degeneracy of genetic code based on
a mathematical point of view using a parameter named Impression. Classification
of protein family is also a long standing problem in the field of Bio-chemistry
and Genomics. Proteins belonging to a particular class have some similar
bio-chemical properties which are of utmost importance for new drug design.
Using the same parameter Impression and using graph theoretic properties we
have also devised a new way of classifying a protein family.

    <title>Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence: a Proposal for
  Precision/Personalized Evidence-Based Medicine</title>
    <summary>  Precision medicine emerges as the most important contemporary paradigm shift
of medical practice but has several challenges in evidence formation and
implementation for clinical practice. Precision/Personalized evidence-based
medicine (pEBM) requires theoretical support for decision making and
information management. This study aims to provide the required methodological
framework. Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence mainly rests upon
Generalized Theory of Uncertainty which manages information as generalized
constraints rather than limited statistical data, and also Prototype
Resemblance Theory of Disease which defines diseases/conditions when there is a
similarity relationship with prototypes (best examples of the disease). The
proposed theory explains that precisely-personalized structure of evidence is
formed as a generalized constraint on particular research questions, where the
constraining relation deals with averaged effect sizes of studies and its
comparison to null hypothesis; which might be of either probabilistic or
possibilistic nature. Similarity measures were employed to deal with
comparisons of high-dimensional characteristics. Real examples of a
meta-analysis and its clinical application are provided. This is one of the
first attempts for introducing a framework in medicine, which provides optimal
balance between generalizability of formed evidence and homogeneity of studied
populations.

    <title>The burden of HIV in a Public Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa</title>
    <summary>  South Africa has the greatest number of people living with HIV in the world
but the direct impact of this on the public health system has not been directly
measured. Using data from the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, the largest
hospital in the Southern Hemisphere, collected between January 2006 and
December 2009, we demonstrate directly the scale of the impact of HIV on
mortality in health services in the pubic sector in South Africa. During the
period under investigation 14,431 people died in the hospital's medical wards,
an average of 11 deaths each day. Of those that died 64 per cent of men and 82
per cent of women were HIV positive. Between the ages of 30 and 40, 94 percent
of men and 96 percent of women of those that died were HIV-positive. These data
not only reflect the extraordinary mortality directly attributable to the
epidemic of HIV but also the massive burden placed on the health services at a
time when triple combination therapy was available and these HIV-related deaths
could have been averted.

    <title>Modeling Eating Behaviors: the Role of Environment and Positive Food
  Association Learning via a Ratatouille Effect</title>
    <summary>  Eating behaviors among a large population of children are studied as a
dynamic process driven by nonlinear interactions in the sociocultural school
environment. The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired
by a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th
grades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.
Qualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible
ramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the
community level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the
population-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings
that agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food
association learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient
communities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \textit{Ratatouille} effect
can be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,
a potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the
overall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the
effectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of
institutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,
cultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values
in the community.

    <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Forecasting Remotely Sensed Vegetation
  Health</title>
    <summary>  Drought threatens food and water security around the world, and this threat
is likely to become more severe under climate change. High resolution
predictive information can help farmers, water managers, and others to manage
the effects of drought. We have created an open source tool to produce
short-term forecasts of vegetation health at high spatial resolution, using
data that are global in coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, and training
gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of observations to
predict future values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index. We compared the
predictive power of different sets of variables (raw spectral MODIS data and
Level-3 MODIS products) in two regions with distinct agro-ecological systems,
climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and California. Our tool provides
considerably greater predictive power on held-out datasets than simpler
baseline models.

    <title>Extracellular stimulation of nerve cells with electric current spikes
  induced by voltage steps</title>
    <summary>  A new stimulation paradigm is presented for the stimulation of nerve cells by
extracellular electric currents. In the new paradigm stimulation is achieved
with the current spike induced by a voltage step whenever the voltage step is
applied to a live biological tissue. By experimental evidence and theoretical
arguments, it is shown that this spike is well suited for the stimulation of
nerve cells. Stimulation of the human tongue is used for proof of principle.
Charge injection thresholds are measured for various voltages. The time-profile
of the current spike used in the experiment has a half-width of about 1
microsecond. The decay of the spike is non-exponential. The spike has at least
three distinctly different phases. A Maxwell phase is followed by a
charge-rearrangement phase. Charging of cell membranes is completed in a third
phase. All three phases contribute to depolarization or hyperpolarization of
cell membranes. Due to the short duration of the spike the charge transfer is
very small. The activation time (time of no return) of nerve cell membranes
leading to an action potential is measured and found to be unexpectedly short.
It can become as short as 3 microseconds for a voltage step of 10 V or higher.

    <title>Conditional Response Probabilities Confirm Two Stages of Free Recall,
  Working Memory Very Localized, Second Stage Delocalized, Both with Strong
  Tendencies to Forward Subsequent Recalls</title>
    <summary>  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty working memory and a second stage concludes the recall (Tarnow,
2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974). Here I
investigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40-1 (1962) free
recall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the
presence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement
of the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large
suppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls
between 10 and 40 items away). The second stage forward subsequent recall is
enhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls
are concentrated at small distances. Thus both stages favor forward subsequent
recalls. As in Tarnow (2015), the first stage is much more localized than the
second stage. Working memory capacity is estimated in six ways to be about 4.5
word items for the 40-1 word list.

    <title>Free Recall Shows Similar Reactivation Behavior as Recognition &amp; Cued
  Recall</title>
    <summary>  I find that the total retrieval time in word free recall increases linearly
with the total number of items recalled. Measured slopes, the time to retrieve
an additional item, vary from 1.4-4.5 seconds per item depending upon
presentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list
presentation or not. These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second
linear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the
experiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and
whether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear
relationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,
2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation
mechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time to
retrieve an additional item to a maximum of 7.2 seconds per item if the
probability of recall is near 0%. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued
recall varied with the item type between 0.2 and 1.8 seconds per item (Tarnow,
2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory:
working memory and reactivation.

    <title>Study of human accessibility: physical tests versus numerical simulation</title>
    <summary>  Consideration of physical dimensions of the user population is essential to
design adapted environment. This variability in body dimensions (called
"anthropometry") is involved in design tools commonly used today to assess
user's accommodation (physical mock-ups, population models, database, boundary
manikins, hybrid methods or digital human modeling). Databases are created from
campaigns of measurement. Besides the fact that such measures are costly in
time and money, they give more "static" measures of man. They do not take into
account possible stretching limbs that could allow increased accessibility.
This paper presents a methodology for human body modeling, in a dynamic way,
not static. The methodology allows to highlight influences of design and human
behaviour on reach skills, directly induced by the interaction with real
prototypes and not just considered by human physical dimensions. The first part
of the method is to create a database of measurements (arms length, hip
breadth, etc.). From these data, a model of accessibility is proposed. The
accessibility field is determined purely numerically. In parallel, an
experiment is set up to measure the extension of the accessibility field, with
the same people. A comparison of the results is then performed and a new model
of the human body is proposed.

    <title>Modelling Early Transitions Toward Autonomous Protocells</title>
    <summary>  This thesis broadly concerns the origins of life problem, pursuing a joint
approach that combines general philosophical/conceptual reflection on the
problem along with more detailed and formal scientific modelling work oriented
in the conceptual perspective developed. The central subject matter addressed
is the emergence and maintenance of compartmentalised chemistries as precursors
of more complex systems with a proper cellular organization. Whereas an
evolutionary conception of life dominates prebiotic chemistry research and
overflows into the protocells field, this thesis defends that the 'autonomous
systems perspective' of living phenomena is a suitable - arguably the most
suitable - conceptual framework to serve as a backdrop for protocell research.
The autonomy approach allows a careful and thorough reformulation of the
origins of cellular life problem as the problem of how integrated autopoietic
chemical organisation, present in all full-fledged cells, originated and
developed from more simple far-from-equilibrium chemical aggregate systems.

    <title>The "Hard Problem" of Life</title>
    <summary>  Chalmer's famously identified pinpointing an explanation for our subjective
experience as the "hard problem of consciousness". He argued that subjective
experience constitutes a "hard problem" in the sense that its explanation will
ultimately require new physical laws or principles. Here, we propose a
corresponding "hard problem of life" as the problem of how `information' can
affect the world. In this essay we motivate both why the problem of information
as a causal agent is central to explaining life, and why it is hard - that is,
why we suspect that a full resolution of the hard problem of life will, similar
to as has been proposed for the hard problem of consciousness, ultimately not
be reducible to known physical principles.

    <title>Selfish Pups: Weaning Conflict and Milk Theft in Free-Ranging Dogs</title>
    <summary>  Parent-offspring conflict theory predicts the emergence of weaning conflict
between a mother and her offspring arising from skewed relatedness benefits.
Empirical observations of weaning conflict has not been carried out in canids.
In a field-based study on free-ranging dogs we observed that suckling bout
durations reduce, proportion of mother-initiated suckling bouts reduce and
mother-initiated suckling terminations increase, with pup age. We identified
the 7th - 13th week period of pup age as the zone of conflict between the
mother and her pups, beyond which suckling solicitations cease, and before
which suckling refusals are few. We also report for the first time milk theft
by pups who take advantage of the presence of multiple lactating females, due
to the promiscuous mating system of the dogs. This behaviour, though apparently
disadvantageous for the mothers, is perhaps adaptive for the dogs in the face
of high mortality and competition for resources.

    <title>Clever mothers balance time and effort in parental care: a study on
  free-ranging dogs</title>
    <summary>  Mammalian offspring require parental care, at least in the form of suckling
during their early development. While mothers need to invest considerable time
and energy in ensuring the survival of their current offspring, they also need
to optimize their investment in one batch of offspring in order to ensure
future reproduction and hence lifetime reproductive success. Free-ranging dogs
live in small social groups, mate promiscuously, and lack the cooperative
breeding biology of other group living canids. They face high early life
mortality, which in turn reduces fitness benefits of the mother from a batch of
pups. We carried out a field based study on free-ranging dogs in India to
understand the nature of parental care provided by mothers at different stages
of pup development. Using behavioural patterns of mother-pup interactions, we
draw up a timeline of pup ontogeny. Our analysis reveals that mothers cleverly
reduce investment in energy intensive active care and increase passive care as
the pups grow older, thereby keeping overall levels of parental care more or
less constant over pup age.

    <title>Do dogs live in joint families? Understanding allo-parental care in
  free-ranging dogs</title>
    <summary>  Cooperative breeding is an excellent example of altruistic cooperation in
social groups. Domestic dogs have evolved from cooperatively hunting and
breeding ancestors, but have adapted to a facultatively social scavenging
lifestyle on streets, and solitary living in human homes. Pets typically breed
and reproduce under human supervision, but free-ranging dogs can provide
insights into the natural breeding biology of dogs. We conducted a five year
long study on parental care of free-ranging dogs in India. We observed
widespread alloparenting by both adult males and females. Allomothers provided
significantly less care that the mothers, but the putative fathers showed
comparable levels of care with the mothers. However, the nature of care varied;
mothers invested more effort in feeding and allogrooming, while the putative
fathers played and protected more. We were unsure of the relatedness of the
pups with the putative fathers, but all the allomothers were maternal relatives
of the pups, which provides support for both the benefit-of-philopatry and
assured fitness returns hypotheses. Free-ranging dogs are not cooperative
breeders like wolves, but are more similar to communal breeders. Their breeding
biology bears interesting similarities with the human joint family system.

    <title>Stem Cell Networks</title>
    <summary>  We present a general computational theory of stem cell networks and their
developmental dynamics. Stem cell networks are special cases of developmental
control networks. Our theory generates a natural classification of all possible
stem cell networks based on their network architecture. Each stem cell network
has a unique topology and semantics and developmental dynamics that result in
distinct phenotypes. We show that the ideal growth dynamics of multicellular
systems generated by stem cell networks have mathematical properties related to
the coefficients of Pascal's Triangle. The relationship to cancer stem cells
and their control networks is indicated. The theory lays the foundation for a
new research paradigm for understanding and investigating stem cells. The
theory of stem cell networks implies that new methods for generating and
controlling stem cells will become possible.

    <title>Anchoring historical sequences using a new source of astro-chronological
  tie-points</title>
    <summary>  The discovery of past spikes in atmospheric radiocarbon activity, caused by
major solar energetic particle events, has opened up new possibilities for
high-precision chronometry. The two spikes, or Miyake Events, have now been
widely identified in tree-rings that grew in the years 775 and 994 CE.
Furthermore, all other plant material that grew in these years would also have
incorporated the anomalously high concentrations of radiocarbon. Crucially,
some plant-based artefacts, such as papyrus documents, timber beams and linen
garments, can also be allocated to specific positions within long, currently
unfixed, historical sequences. Thus, Miyake Events represent a new source of
tie-points that could provide the means for anchoring early chronologies to the
absolute timescale. Here, we explore this possibility, outlining the most
expeditious approaches, the current challenges and obstacles, and how they
might best be overcome.

    <title>Correlations in Usage Frequencies and Shannon Entropy for Codons</title>
    <summary>  The usage frequencies for codons belonging to quartets are analized, over the
whole exonic region, for 92 biological species. Correlation is put into
evidence, between the usage frequencies of synonymous codons with third
nucleotide A and C and between the usage frequencies of non synonymous codons,
belonging to suitable subsets of the quartets, with the same third nucleotide.
A correlation is pointed out between amino acids belonging to subsets of the
set encoded by quartets of codons. It is remarked that the computed Shannon
entropy for quartets is weakly dependent on the biological species. The
observed correlations well fit in the mathematical scheme of the crystal basis
model of the genetic code.

    <title>Conservation of Charge and Conservation of Current</title>
    <summary>  Conservation of current and conservation of charge are nearly the same thing:
when enough is known about charge movement, conservation of current can be
derived from conservation of charge, in ideal dielectrics, for example.
Conservation of current is enforced implicitly in ideal dielectrics by theories
that conserve charge. But charge movement in real materials like semiconductors
or ionic solutions is never ideal. We present an apparently universal
derivation of conservation of current and advocate using that conservation law
explicitly as a distinct part of theories and calculations of charge movement
in complex fluids and environments. Classical models using ordinary
differential equations rarely satisfy conservation of current, including the
chemical kinetic models implementing the law of mass action and Markov models.
These models must be amended if they are to conserve current. Strict
enforcement of conservation of current is likely to aid numerical analysis by
preventing artifactual accumulation of charge.

    <title>Biophysical growth and reproduction mechanisms of cells and first
  principles of life origin and development</title>
    <summary>  There are evidences that organic life cannot be reduced to a single
biomolecular realm, but, similar to other natural phenomena, rather involves
different mechanisms acting at different scale levels, which together define
evolvement of the living world. Here we show that a certain biophysical
mechanism of general nature, acting at a cellular scale level and above, is
also an influential factor in life phenomena. In inherent unity with
biomolecular mechanisms, it governs growth and reproduction of cells, organs
and whole organisms, and secures irreversibility of the life cycle progression.
For validation of proposed concepts, we study the growth and division of B.
subtilis, Staphylococcus, E. coli, S. pombe and Amoeba using extensive
experimental observations. A well founded hypothesis is presented why and how
cells grow and divide. The study also sheds light on other pertinent problems
of biology, biophysics, and first principles of life origin and development.

    <title>Position and content paradigms in genome rearrangements: the wild and
  crazy world of permutations in genomics</title>
    <summary>  Modellers of large scale genome rearrangement events, in which segments of
DNA are inverted, moved, swapped, or even inserted or deleted, have found a
natural syntax in the language of permutations. Despite this, there has been a
wide range of modelling choices, assumptions and interpretations that make
navigating the literature a significant challenge. Indeed, even authors of
papers that use permutations to model genome rearrangement can struggle to
interpret each others' work, because of subtle differences in basic assumptions
that are often deeply ingrained (and consequently sometimes not even
mentioned). In this paper, we describe the different ways in which permutations
have been used to model genomes and genome rearrangement events, presenting
some features and limitations of each approach, and show how the various models
are related. This paper will help researchers navigate the landscape of genome
rearrangement models, and make it easier for authors to present clear and
consistent models.

    <title>Space nutrition: the key role of nutrition in human space flight</title>
    <summary>  From the basic impact of nutrient intake on health maintenance to the
psychosocial benefits of mealtime, great advancements in nutritional sciences
for support of human space travel have occurred over the past 60 years.
Nutrition in space has many areas of impact, including provision of required
nutrients and maintenance of endocrine, immune, and musculoskeletal systems. It
is affected by environmental conditions such as radiation, temperature, and
atmospheric pressures, and these are reviewed. Nutrition with respect to space
flight is closely interconnected with other life sciences research disciplines
including the study of hematology, immunology, as well as neurosensory,
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, circadian rhythms, and musculoskeletal
physiology. Psychosocial aspects of nutrition are also important for more
productive missions and crew morale. Research conducted to determine the impact
of spaceflight on human physiology and subsequent nutritional requirements will
also have direct and indirect applications in Earth-based nutrition research.
Cumulative nutritional research over the past five decades has resulted in the
current nutritional requirements for astronauts. Realization of the full role
of nutrition during spaceflight is critical for the success of
extended-duration missions. Long-duration missions will require quantitation of
nutrient requirements for maintenance of health and protection against the
effects of microgravity.

    <title>Why cells grow and divide? General growth mechanism and how it defines
  cells' growth, reproduction and metabolic properties</title>
    <summary>  We consider a general growth mechanism, which acts at cellular level and
above (organs, systems and whole organisms). Using its mathematical
representation, the growth equation, we study the growth and division
mechanisms of amoeba and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show how
this mechanism, together with biomolecular machinery, governs growth and
reproduction of cells, and these organisms in particular. This mechanism
provides revealing answers to fundamental questions of biology, like why cells
grow and divide, why and when cells' growth stops. It also sheds light on
questions like why and how life originated and developed. Solving the growth
equation, we obtain analytical expression for the growth curve of fission yeast
as a function of geometrical characteristics and nutrient influxes for RNA and
protein synthesis, and compare the computed growth curves with 85 experiments.
Statistical evaluation shows that these growth curves correspond to
experimental data significantly better than all previous approximations. Also,
using the general growth mechanism, we show how metabolic characteristics of
cells, their size and evolutionary traits relate, considering fission yeast. In
particular, we found that fission yeast S. pombe consumes about 16-18 times
more nutrients for maintenance needs than for biomass synthesis.

    <title>Quantitative Molecular Scaling Theory of Protein Amino Acid Sequences,
  Structure, and Functionality</title>
    <summary>  Here we review the development of protein scaling theory, starting from
backgrounds in mathematics and statistical mechanics, and leading to biomedical
applications. Evolution has organized each protein family in different ways,
but scaling theory is both simple and effective in providing readily
transferable dynamical insights complementary for many proteins represented in
the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base
(PDB). Scaling theory is a simplifying magic wand that enables one to search
the hundreds of millions of protein articles in the Web of Science, and
identify those proteins that present new cost-effective methods for early
detection and/or treatment of disease through individual protein sequences
(personalized medicine). Critical point theory is general, and recently it has
proved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have
evolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments
(self-organized criticality). Evolutionary patterns are governed by common
scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been
developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of PDB structures. The most
effective scales involve either hydropathic globular sculpting interactions
averaged over length scales centered on membrane dimensions, or exposed beta
strand propensities associated with aggregative (strong) protein-protein
interactions.

    <title>Giant Hub Src and Syk Tyrosine Kinase Thermodynamic Profiles
  Recapitulate Evolution</title>
    <summary>  Thermodynamic scaling theory, previously applied mainly to small proteins,
here analyzes quantitative evolution of the titled functional network giant hub
enzymes. The broad domain structure identified homologically is confirmed
hydropathically using amino acid sequences only. The most surprising results
concern the evolution of the tyrosine kinase globular surface roughness from
avian to mammals, which is first order, compared to the evolution within
mammals from rodents to humans, which is second order. The mystery of the
unique amide terminal region of proto oncogene tyrosine protein kinase is
resolved by the discovery there of a septad targeting cluster, which is
paralleled by an octad catalytic cluster in tyrosine kinase in humans and a few
other species. These results, which go far towards explaining why these
proteins are among the largest giant hubs in protein interaction networks, use
no adjustable parameters.

    <title>Interspecific allometric scaling of unicellular organisms as an
  evolutionary process of food chain creation</title>
    <summary>  Metabolism of living organisms is a foundation of life. The metabolic rate
(energy production per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass. When
this phenomenon is considered across different species, it is called
interspecific allometric scaling, whose causes are unknown. We argue that the
cause of interspecific allometric scaling is the total effect of physiological
and adaptation mechanisms inherent to organisms composing a food chain.
Together, the workings of these mechanisms are united by a primary goal of any
living creature - its successful reproduction. This primary necessity of each
organism and of the entire food chain is that common denominator, to which all
organisms adjust their metabolic rates. In this article, we consider
unicellular organisms, while the second paper studies multicellular organisms
and the entire concept in more detail. Here, using the proposed concepts and
experimentally verified growth models of five different unicellular organisms,
we obtain close to experimental findings values of allometric exponents of
0.757 for the end of growth and 0.853 for the beginning of growth. These
results comply with experimental observations and prove our theory that the
requirement of successful reproduction within the food chain is an important
factor shaping interspecific allometric scaling.

    <title>The role of food chain balance and common nutritional environment in
  interspecific allometric scaling of unicellular organisms</title>
    <summary>  One of the major characteristics of living organisms is metabolic rate - the
amount of energy produced per unit time. When the size of organisms increases,
the metabolic rate increases slower than organisms' mass, which has important
implications for the evolutionary and ontogenetic development. Here, we study
the fundamental causes of this phenomenon on the basis of metabolic properties
of unicellular organisms (Amoeba Proteus, fission yeast S. pombe, E. coli, B.
subtilis, Staphylococcus). We use a new approach for finding metabolic
characteristics of unicellular organisms. The study discovered that the
metabolic properties and allometric scaling of unicellular organisms are
defined by at least two primary factors. One is the acquisition of nutrients
through the surface in a common nutritional environment, which forms the base
part of 2/3 of an allometric exponent. The other factor is a regular increase
of nutrient influx per unit surface when one ascends the food chain and
organisms' mass increases. Accounting for the increase of nutrient influx and
its variations, we obtained allometric exponents close to values obtained in
experiments. We conjecture that the metabolic properties of living organisms
are much influenced by the requirement of a balanced state of an entire food
chain.

    <title>CHROTRAN: A mathematical and computational model for in situ heavy metal
  remediation in heterogeneous aquifers</title>
    <summary>  Groundwater contamination by heavy metals is a critical environmental problem
for which in situ remediation is frequently the only viable treatment option.
For such interventions, a three-dimensional reactive transport model of
relevant biogeochemical processes is invaluable. To this end, we developed a
model, CHROTRAN, for in situ treatment, which includes full dynamics for five
species: a heavy metal to be remediated, an electron donor, biomass, a nontoxic
conservative bio-inhibitor, and a biocide. Direct abiotic reduction by
donor-metal interaction as well as donor-driven biomass growth and
bio-reduction are modeled, along with crucial processes such as donor sorption,
bio-fouling and biomass death. Our software implementation handles
heterogeneous flow fields, arbitrarily many chemical species and amendment
injection points, and features full coupling between flow and reactive
transport. We describe installation and usage and present two example
simulations demonstrating its unique capabilities. One simulation suggests an
unorthodox approach to remediation of Cr(VI) contamination.

    <title>A new integrated symmetrical table for genetic codes</title>
    <summary>  Degeneracy is a salient feature of genetic codes, because there are more
codons than amino acids. The conventional table for genetic codes suffers from
an inability of illustrating a symmetrical nature among genetic base codes. In
fact, because the conventional wisdom avoids the question, there is little
agreement as to whether the symmetrical nature actually even exists. A better
understanding of symmetry and an appreciation for its essential role in the
genetic code formation can improve our understanding of nature coding
processes. Thus, it is worth formulating a new integrated symmetrical table for
genetic codes, which is presented in this paper. It could be very useful to
understand the Nobel laureate Crick wobble hypothesis: how one transfer
ribonucleic acid can recognize two or more synonymous codons, which is an
unsolved fundamental question in biological science.

    <title>Biochemical mechanism of resistance in some Brassica genotypes against
  Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) (Homoptera: Aphididae)</title>
    <summary>  Two years study was carried out during 2006-07 and 2007-08 crop seasons to
study the response of different genotypes of oilseeds Brassica to Lipaphis
erysimi (Kaltenbach) infestation both under field and screen house conditions
and to find out the relationship of various biochemical constituents to aphid
infestation. Among the various genotypes, the population of L. erysimi was
significantly high on Brassica rapa variety brown sarson cv. BSH 1 and B. rapa
var. yellow sarson cv. YST 151 in unprotected set i.e. 53.7 and 52.3 aphids/
plant, respectively. However, it was the lowest on Eruca sativa cv. T 27 (4.7
aphids/plant) followed by B. carinata cv. DLSC 2 (20.9 aphids/ plant) which
suffered the least yield loss i.e. 5.79 and 10.59 per cent, respectively.
Almost similar trend was observed in seedling mortality, which was the maximum
in BSH 1 and YST 151, while no seedling mortality was observed in the case of T
27 during both the years of study. Analysis of various biochemical constituents
revealed that glucosinolates, total phenols and ortho-dihydroxy phenols had
inverse relationship with the aphid infestation. Higher amount of these
biochemical constituents in T 27 and DLSC 2 was responsible for lower aphid
infestation on these genotypes.

    <title>Measuring Light Pollution with Fisheye Lens Imagery from A Moving Boat,
  A Proof of Concept</title>
    <summary>  Near all-sky imaging photometry was performed from a boat on the Gulf of
Aqaba to measure the night sky brightness in a coastal environment. The boat
was not anchored, and therefore drifted and rocked. The camera was mounted on a
tripod without any inertia/motion stabilization. A commercial digital single
lens reflex (DSLR) camera and fisheye lens were used with ISO setting of 6400,
with the exposure time varied between 0.5 s and 5 s. We find that despite
movement of the vessel the measurements produce quantitatively comparable
results apart from saturation effects. We discuss the potential and limitations
of this method for mapping light pollution in marine and freshwater systems.
This work represents the proof of concept that all-sky photometry with a
commercial DSLR camera is a viable tool to determine light pollution in an
ecological context from a moving boat.

    <title>Symmetry and Minimum Principle at the Basis of the Genetic Code</title>
    <summary>  The importance of the notion of symmetry in physics is well established:
could it also be the case for the genetic code? In this spirit, a model for the
Genetic Code based on continuous symmetries and entitled the "Crystal Basis
Model" has been proposed a few years ago. The present paper is a review of the
model, of some of its first applications as well as of its recent developments.
Indeed, after a motivated presentation of our mathematical model, we illustrate
its pertinence by applying it for the elaboration and verification of sum rules
for codon usage probabilities, as well as for establishing relations and some
predictions between physical-chemical properties of amino-acids. Then, defining
in this context a "bio-spin" structure for the nucleotides and codons, the
interaction between a couple of codon-anticodon can simply be represented by a
(bio) spin-spin potential. This approach will constitute the second part of the
paper where, imposing the minimum energy principle, an analysis of the
evolution of the genetic code can be performed with good agreement with the
generally accepted scheme. A more precise study of this interaction model
provides informations on codon bias, consistent with data.

    <title>Mathematical Analysis of the Probability of Spontaneous Mutations in
  HIV-1 Genome and Their Role in the Emergence of Resistance to Anti-Retroviral
  Therapy</title>
    <summary>  $\textbf{Background:}$ High mutability of HIV is the driving force of
antiretroviral drug resistance, which represents a medical care challenge.
  $\textbf{Method and Model Equation:}$ To detect the mutability of each gene
in the HIV-1 genome; a mathematical analysis of HIV-1 genome is performed,
depending on a linear relation wherein the probability of spontaneous mutations
emergence is directly proportional to the ratio of the gene length to the whole
genome length. \begin{equation*} {P_g}{S_i} =\frac{g}{G} \end{equation*}
  $\textbf{Results:}$ $\textbf{tat}$, $\textbf{vpr}$ and $\textbf{vpu}$ are the
least mutant genes in HIV-1 genome. Protease $\textbf{PROT}$ gene is the least
mutant gene component of the polymerases $\textbf{pol}$.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ $\textbf{tat}$, $\textbf{vpr}$ and $\textbf{vpu}$ are
the best candidates for HIV-1 recombinant subunit vaccines or as a part of
$\textit{prime and boost}$ vaccine combinations. Also; the protease
inhibitor-based regime represents a high genetic barrier for HIV to overcome.

    <title>Numerical investigation of Differential Biological-Models via GA-Kansa
  Method Inclusive Genetic Strategy</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we use Kansa method for solving the system of differential
equations in the area of biology. One of the challenges in Kansa method is
picking out an optimum value for Shape parameter in Radial Basis Function to
achieve the best result of the method because there are not any available
analytical approaches for obtaining optimum Shape parameter. For this reason,
we design a genetic algorithm to detect a close optimum Shape parameter. The
experimental results show that this strategy is efficient in the systems of
differential models in biology such as HIV and Influenza. Furthermore, we prove
that using Pseudo-Combination formula for crossover in genetic strategy leads
to convergence in the nearly best selection of Shape parameter.

    <title>Time as it could Be measured in Artificial Living Systems</title>
    <summary>  Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It permits it to predict regular events, and prepare
for them on time. Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the present paper,
we consider the most minimal abstract pure clocks and investigate their
characteristics with respect to their ability to measure time. Amongst other,
we find fundamentally diametral clock characteristics, such as oscillatory
behaviour for local time measurement or decay-based clocks measuring time
periods in scales global to the problem. We include also cascades of
independent clocks ("clock bags") and composite clocks with controlled
dependency; the latter show various regimes of markedly different dynamics.

    <title>Implications of the Trivers-Willard Sex Ratio Hypothesis for Avian
  Species and Poultry Production, And a Summary of the Historic Context of this
  Research</title>
    <summary>  At a theoretical level, the Trivers-Willard Sex Ratio Hypothesis applies to
both avian species and mammals. This article, however, conjectures that at the
statistical level, sex ratio effects are likely to produce sharper numerical
variations among birds than among mammals. We explain this greater statistical
variation should likely have beneficial implications for increasing the
efficiency of world-wide poultry egg (and perhaps also meat) production.

    <title>Self-Organization and Fractality in the Metabolic Process of Glycolysis</title>
    <summary>  Within a mathematical model, the metabolic process of glycolysis is studied.
The general scheme of glycolysis is considered as a natural result of the
biochemical evolution. By using the theory of dissipative structures, the
conditions of self-organization of the given process are sought. The
autocatalytic processes resulting in the conservation of cyclicity in the
dynamics of the process are determined. The conditions of breaking of the
synchronization of the process, increase in the multiplicity of a cyclicity,
and appearance of chaotic modes are studied. The phase-parametric diagrams of a
cascade of bifurcations, which characterize the transition to chaotic modes
according to the Feigenbaum scenario and the intermittence, are constructed.
The strange attractors formed as a result of the funnel effect are found. The
complete spectra of Lyapunov indices and divergences for the obtained modes are
calculated. The values of KS-entropy, horizons of predictability, and Lyapunov
dimensions of strange attractors are determined. Some conclusions concerning
the structural-functional connections in glycolysis and their influence on the
stability of the metabolic process in a cell are presented.

    <title>Using PCA and Factor Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction of
  Bio-informatics Data</title>
    <summary>  Large volume of Genomics data is produced on daily basis due to the
advancement in sequencing technology. This data is of no value if it is not
properly analysed. Different kinds of analytics are required to extract useful
information from this raw data. Classification, Prediction, Clustering and
Pattern Extraction are useful techniques of data mining. These techniques
require appropriate selection of attributes of data for getting accurate
results. However, Bioinformatics data is high dimensional, usually having
hundreds of attributes. Such large a number of attributes affect the
performance of machine learning algorithms used for classification/prediction.
So, dimensionality reduction techniques are required to reduce the number of
attributes that can be further used for analysis. In this paper, Principal
Component Analysis and Factor Analysis are used for dimensionality reduction of
Bioinformatics data. These techniques were applied on Leukaemia data set and
the number of attributes was reduced from to.

    <title>Promoting lentil germination and stem growth by plasma activated tap
  water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer</title>
    <summary>  Tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer have been activated
using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to investigate their benefits
for the germination rate and stem elongation rate of lentils from Puy-en-Velay
(France). By plasma-activating tap water, we have obtained germination rates as
high as 80% (instead of 30% with tap water). Also, higher stem elongation rates
and final stem lengths were obtained using activated tap water compared with
commercial fertilizer. We show that these rates of germination and stem growth
strongly depend on the combination of two radicals generated in the liquids by
the plasma: hydrogen peroxide and nitrate. This synergy appears to be a
condition for releasing seed dormancy through the endogenous production of NO
radicals.

    <title>Screening of Fungi for Self-Healing of Concrete Cracks</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this study is to explore a new self-healing concept in which
fungi are used as a self-healing agent to promote calcium mineral precipitation
to fill the cracks in concrete. Although many species of fungi have been
reported to be able to promote calcium mineralization, they have not yet been
investigated in the application of self-healing concrete, thus an initial
screening of different species of fungi has been conducted. The experimental
results showed that, due to the leaching of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, the pH of
the growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the
drastic pH increase, Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into
hyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete. We employed
material characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
scanning electron microscope (SEM), both of which confirmed that the crystals
precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite.

    <title>The rules of long DNA-sequences and tetra-groups of oligonucleotides</title>
    <summary>  The article is devoted to hidden symmetries in long sequences of
oligonucleotides of single stranded DNA. The notions of tetra-groups of
oligonucleotides and also collective frequencies and collective probabilities
of members of the tetra-groups are introduced to study hidden tetra-group
regularities in mentioned sequences. Each of such tetra-group contains 4
members, each of which combines 4^(n-1) oligonucleotides with the same length n
in accordance with their certain attributes. Results of comparison analysis of
collective probabilities of separate members of the tetra-groups for a
representative set of long nucleotide sequences are shown. These results give
evidences in favor of existence of the suppositional tetra-group rules of
oligonucleotides in single stranded DNA in addition to the second Chargaff's
parity rule. An algebraic approach to model the described genetic phenomena is
proposed.

    <title>Disease Spreading in Structured Scale-Free Networks</title>
    <summary>  We study the spreading of a disease on top of structured scale-free networks
recently introduced. By means of numerical simulations we analyze the SIS and
the SIR models. Our results show that when the connectivity fluctuations of the
network are unbounded whether the epidemic threshold exists strongly depends on
the initial density of infected individuals and the type of epidemiological
model considered. Analytical arguments are provided in order to account for the
observed behavior. We conclude that the peculiar topological features of this
network and the absence of small-world properties determine the dynamics of
epidemic spreading.

    <title>Fitness for Synchronization of Network Motifs</title>
    <summary>  We study the phase synchronization of Kuramoto's oscillators in small parts
of networks known as motifs. We first report on the system dynamics for the
case of a scale-free network and show the existence of a non-trivial critical
point. We compute the probability that network motifs synchronize, and find
that the fitness for synchronization correlates well with motif's
interconnectedness and structural complexity. Possible implications for present
debates about network evolution in biological and other systems are discussed.

    <title>Dielectrophoresis of nanoscale dsDNA and humidity effects on its
  electrical conductivity</title>
    <summary>  The dielectrophoresis method for trapping and attaching nanoscale
double-stranded DNA between nanoelectrodes was developed. The method gives a
high yield of trapping single or a few molecules only which enables transport
measurements at the single molecule level. Electrical conductivity of
individual 140-nm-long DNA molecules was measured, showing insulating behavior
in dry conditions. In contrast, clear enhancement of conductivity was observed
in moist conditions, relating to the interplay between the conformation of DNA
molecules and their conductivity.

    <title>Complex noise in diffusion-limited reactions of replicating and
  competing species</title>
    <summary>  We derive exact Langevin-type equations governing quasispecies dynamics. The
inherent multiplicative noise has both real and imaginary parts. The numerical
simulation of the underlying complex stochastic partial differential equations
is carried out employing the Cholesky decomposition for the noise covariance
matrix. This noise produces unavoidable spatio-temporal density fluctuations
about the mean field value. In two dimensions, the fluctuations are suppressed
only when the diffusion time scale is much smaller than the amplification time
scale for the master species.

    <title>Bias in the journal impact factor</title>
    <summary>  The ISI journal impact factor (JIF) is based on a sample that may represent
half the whole-of-life citations to some journals, but a small fraction (&lt;10%)
of the citations accruing to other journals. This disproportionate sampling
means that the JIF provides a misleading indication of the true impact of
journals, biased in favour of journals that have a rapid rather than a
prolonged impact. Many journals exhibit a consistent pattern of citation
accrual from year to year, so it may be possible to adjust the JIF to provide a
more reliable indication of a journal's impact.

    <title>Small world effect in an epidemiological model</title>
    <summary>  A model for the spread of an infection is analyzed for different population
structures. The interactions within the population are described by small world
networks, ranging from ordered lattices to random graphs. For the more ordered
systems, there is a fluctuating endemic state of low infection. At a finite
value of the disorder of the network, we find a transition to self-sustained
oscillations in the size of the infected subpopulation.

    <title>A Historical Perspective on Cancer</title>
    <summary>  It is proposed that cancer results from the breakdown of universal control
mechanisms which developed in mutual association as part of the historical
process that brought individual cells together into multi-cellular communities.
By systematically comparing the genomes of uni-celled with multi-celled
organisms, one might be able to identify the most promising sites for
intervention aimed at restoring the damaged control mechanisms and thereby
arresting the cancer.

    <title>Comment on "Swarming Ring Patterns in Bacterial Colonies Exposed to
  Ultraviolet Radiation"</title>
    <summary>  Commenting on the paper "Swarming Ring Patterns in Bacterial Colonies Exposed
to Ultraviolet Radiation" of A.M. Delprato et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 87, 158102
(2001) we point out that their observed ring pattern formation by colonies of
soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation might be
caused by the artificial confinement of motile bacteria evolved to live in a
3-dimensional environment to a 2-dimensional geometry. We propose that to
investigate the reaction of Bacillus subtilis to UV radiation coming from
above, a seminal experiment should have a 3-dimensional setup.

    <title>Mutation model for oligonucleotides fitting a Yule distribution</title>
    <summary>  A spin chain, describing a nucleotides sequence, is identified by the labels
of a vector state of an irreducible representation of U_q-&gt;0(sl2). A master
equation for the distribution function is written, where the intensity of the
one-spin flip is assumed to depend on the variation of the labels. The
numerically computed equilibrium distribution is nicely fitted by a Yule
distribution, which is the observed distribution of the ranked short
oligonucleotides frequency in DNA

    <title>Morphogen Gradient from a Noisy Source</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the effect of time-dependent noise on the shape of a morphogen
gradient in a developing embryo. Perturbation theory is used to calculate the
deviations from deterministic behavior in a simple reaction-diffusion model of
robust gradient formation, and the results are confirmed by numerical
simulation. It is shown that such deviations can disrupt robustness for
sufficiently high noise levels, and the implications of these findings for more
complex models of gradient-shaping pathways are discussed.

    <title>Role-similarity based functional prediction in networked systems:
  Application to the yeast proteome</title>
    <summary>  We propose a general method to predict functions of vertices where: 1. The
wiring of the network is somehow related to the vertex functionality. 2. A
fraction of the vertices are functionally classified. The method is influenced
by role-similarity measures of social network analysis. The two versions of our
prediction scheme is tested on model networks were the functions of the
vertices are designed to match their network surroundings. We also apply these
methods to the proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find the
results compatible with more specialized methods.

    <title>Dynamics of conduction blocks in a model of paced cardiac tissue</title>
    <summary>  We study numerically the dynamics of conduction blocks using a detailed
electrophysiological model. We find that this dynamics depends critically on
the size of the paced region. Small pacing regions lead to stationary
conduction blocks while larger pacing regions can lead to conduction blocks
that travel periodically towards the pacing region. We show that this
size-dependence dynamics can lead to a novel arrhythmogenic mechanism.
Furthermore, we show that the essential phenomena can be captured in a much
simpler coupled-map model.

    <title>Dynamics of Heterogeneous Populations and Communities and Evolution of
  Distributions</title>
    <summary>  Most population models assume that individuals within a given population are
identical, that is, the fundamental role of variation is ignored. Inhomogeneous
models of populations and communities allow for birth and death rates to vary
among individuals; recently, theorems of existence and asymptotic of solutions
of such models were investigated. Here we develop another approach to modeling
heterogeneous populations by reducing the model to the Cauchy problem for a
special system of ODEs. As a result, the total population size and current
distribution of the vector-parameter can be found in explicit analytical form
or computed effectively. The developed approach is extended to the models of
inhomogeneous communities.

    <title>Dynamical Structure Functions for the Estimation of LTI Networks with
  Limited Information</title>
    <summary>  This research explores the role and representation of network structure for
LTI Systems. We demonstrate that transfer functions contain no structural
information without more assumptions being made about the system, assumptions
that we believe are unreasonable when dealing with truly complex systems. We
then introduce Dynamical Structure Functions as an alternative, graphical-model
based representation of LTI systems that contain both dynamical and structural
information of the system. We use Dynamical Structure to prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for estimating structure from data, and demonstrate, for
example, the danger of attempting to use steady-state information to estimate
network structure.

    <title>An axiomatic theory for interaction between species in ecology: Gause's
  exclusion conjecture</title>
    <summary>  I introduce an axiomatic representation, called ecoset, to consider
interactions between species in ecological systems. For interspecific
competition, the exclusion conjecture (Gause) is put in a symbolic way and used
as a basic operational tool to consider more complex cases like two species
with two superposed resources (niche differentiation) and apparent competitors.
Competition between tortoises and invaders in Galapagos islands is considered
as a specific example. Our theory gives us an operative language to consider
elementary process in ecology and open a route to more complex systems.

    <title>Quantum dissipation and neural net dynamics</title>
    <summary>  Inspired by the dissipative quantum model of brain, we model the states of
neural nets in terms of collective modes by the help of the formalism of
Quantum Field Theory. We exhibit an explicit neural net model which allows to
memorize a sequence of several informations without reciprocal destructive
interference, namely we solve the overprinting problem in such a way last
registered information does not destroy the ones previously registered.
Moreover, the net is able to recall not only the last registered information in
the sequence, but also anyone of those previously registered.

    <title>Quantum noise induced entanglement and chaos in the dissipative quantum
  model of brain</title>
    <summary>  We discuss some features of the dissipative quantum model of brain in the
frame of the formalism of quantum dissipation. Such a formalism is based on the
doubling of the system degrees of freedom. We show that the doubled modes
account for the quantum noise in the fluctuating random force in the
system-environment coupling. Remarkably, such a noise manifests itself through
the coherent structure of the system ground state. The entanglement of the
system modes with the doubled modes is shown to be permanent in the infinite
volume limit. In such a limit the trajectories in the memory space are
classical chaotic trajectories.

    <title>Criteria for quantum coherent transfer of excitons between chromophores
  in a polar solvent</title>
    <summary>  We show that the quantum decoherence of Forster resonant energy transfer
between two optically active molecules can be described by a spin-boson model.
This allows us to give quantitative criteria, in terms of experimentally
measurable system parameters, that are necessary for coherent Bloch
oscillations of excitons between the chromophores. Experimental tests of our
results should be possible with Flourescent Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET)
spectroscopy. Although we focus on the case of protein-pigment complexes our
results are also relevant to quantum dots and organic molecules in a dielectric
medium.

    <title>Darwinian Dynamics Implies Developmental Ascendency</title>
    <summary>  A tendency in biological theorizing is to formulate principles above or equal
to Evolution by Variation and Selection of Darwin and Wallace. In this letter I
analyze one such recent proposal which did so for the developmental ascendency.
I show that though the idea of developmental ascendency is brilliant, this is
in wrong order in the hierarchical structure of biological theories and can
easily generate confusing. Several other examples are also briefly discussed in
the note added.

    <title>The prisoners dilemma on a stochastic non-growth network evolution model</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the evolution of cooperation on a non - growth network model
with death/birth dynamics. Nodes reproduce under selection for higher payoffs
in a prisoners dilemma game played between network neighbours. The mean field
characteristics of the model are explored and an attempt is made to understand
the size dependent behaviour of the model in terms of fluctuations in the
strategy densities. We also briefly comment on the role of strategy mutation in
regulating the strategy densties.

    <title>Information retrieval from a phoneme time series database</title>
    <summary>  Developing fast and efficient algorithms for retrieval of objects to a given
user query is an area of active research. The present study investigates
retrieval of time series objects from a phoneme database to a given user
pattern or query. The proposed method maps the one-dimensional time series
retrieval into a sequence retrieval problem by partitioning the
multi-dimensional phase-space using k-means clustering. The problem of whole
sequence as well as subsequence matching is considered. Robustness of the
proposed technique is investigated on phoneme time series corrupted with
additive white Gaussian noise. The shortcoming of classical power-spectral
techniques for time series retrieval is also discussed.

    <title>Study Of Spatial Biological Systems Using a Graphical User Interface</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we describe a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to
manage large quantities of image data of a biological system. After setting the
design requirements for the system, we developed an ecology quantification GUI
that assists biologists in analysing data. We focus on the main features of the
interface and we present the results and an evaluation of the system. Finally,
we provide some directions for some future work.

exhibited by E. coli) in one dimension. Building on previous analyses at
drift-diffusion level for the one-particle density, we add both interactions
and noise, enabling discussion of domain formation by "self-trapping", and
other collective phenomena. Mapping onto detailed-balance systems is possible
in certain cases.

    <title>Synchronization of oscillators coupled through an environment</title>
    <summary>  We study synchronization of oscillators that are indirectly coupled through
their interaction with an environment. We give criteria for the stability or
instability of a synchronized oscillation. Using these criteria we investigate
synchronization of systems of oscillators which are weakly coupled, in the
sense that the influence of the oscillators on the environment is weak. We
prove that arbitrarily weak coupling will synchronize the oscillators, provided
that this coupling is of the 'right' sign. We illustrate our general results by
applications to a model of coupled GnRH neuron oscillators proposed by Khadra
and Li, and to indirectly weakly-coupled lambda-omega oscillators

    <title>Hierarchies of Biocomplexity: modeling lifes energetic complexity</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, a model for understanding the effects of selection using
systems- level computational approaches is introduced. A number of concepts and
principles essential for understanding the motivation for constructing the
model will be introduced first. This will be followed by a description of
parameters, measurements, and graphical representations used in the model. Four
possible outcomes for this model are then introduced and described. In
addition, the relationship of relative fitness to selection is described.
Finally, the consequences and potential lessons learned from the model are
discussed.

    <title>On Pattern and Evolution</title>
    <summary>  A model of pattern formation in living systems is presented. The pattern is
achieved by the sequential interaction of two signaling pathways. The coupling
of the pattern to the (thick) epithelial sheet changes is given, when the Gauss
curvature'K'enters. The model suggests a novel point-like placement for organs
such as eyes, antennae, limbs, and wings. In the case of plant patterns, 'leaf'
outgrowths from a stem are predicted to be under the control of a yet to be
discovered "master regulatiory gene", analogous to the animal case, when
various outgrowths from the animal body are generally accompanied by activation
of the 'distal-less' (Dll) gene.

    <title>Coherent states, fractals and brain waves</title>
    <summary>  I show that a functional representation of self-similarity (as the one
occurring in fractals) is provided by squeezed coherent states. In this way,
the dissipative model of brain is shown to account for the self-similarity in
brain background activity suggested by power-law distributions of power
spectral densities of electrocorticograms. I also briefly discuss the
action-perception cycle in the dissipative model with reference to
intentionality in terms of trajectories in the memory state space.

    <title>Scaling of human body mass with height: the Body Mass Index revisited</title>
    <summary>  We adapt a biomechanical argument of Rashevsky, which places limits on the
stress experienced by a torso supported by the legs, to deduce that body mass
$m$ of growing children should scale as the $p$th power of height $h$ with
$7/3&lt;p&lt;8/3$. Further arguments based on stability and heat loss suggest that
$p$ should be close to 8/3. The arguments are extended to suggest that waist
circumference $w$ should scale as $h^q$ with $q$ near the lower end of $2/3\leq
q \leq 1$. Data from Hong Kong and British children are consistent with these
hypotheses.

    <title>Data management in Systems biology II - Outlook towards the semantic web</title>
    <summary>  The benefit of using ontologies, defined by the respective data standards, is
shown. It is presented how ontologies can be used for the semantic enrichment
of data and how this can contribute to the vision of the semantic web to become
true. The problems existing today on the way to a true semantic web are
pinpointed, different semantic web standards, tools and development frameworks
are overlooked and an outlook towards artificial intelligence and agents for
searching and mining the data in the semantic web are given, paving the way
from data management to information and in the end true knowledge management
systems.

    <title>Epidemic spreading in evolving networks</title>
    <summary>  A model for epidemic spreading on rewiring networks is introduced and
analyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks. It is found that
contrary to what one would have naively expected, the rewiring process
typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular it is found that
as in static networks, rewiring networks with degree distribution exponent
$\gamma &gt;3$ exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die
out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case.
For $2&lt;\gamma \leq 3$ no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate
the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for rewiring
networks.

    <title>Phase transition in a class of non-linear random networks</title>
    <summary>  We discuss the complex dynamics of a non-linear random networks model, as a
function of the connectivity k between the elements of the network. We show
that this class of networks exhibit an order-chaos phase transition for a
critical connectivity k = 2. Also, we show that both, pairwise correlation and
complexity measures are maximized in dynamically critical networks. These
results are in good agreement with the previously reported studies on random
Boolean networks and random threshold networks, and show once again that
critical networks provide an optimal coordination of diverse behavior.

    <title>Run-and-tumble particles with hydrodynamics: sedimentation, trapping and
  upstream swimming</title>
    <summary>  We simulate by lattice Boltzmann the nonequilibrium steady states of
run-and-tumble particles (inspired by a minimal model of bacteria), interacting
by far-field hydrodynamics, subject to confinement. Under gravity, hydrodynamic
interactions barely perturb the steady state found without them, but for
particles in a harmonic trap such a state is quite changed if the run length is
larger than the confinement length: a self-assembled pump is formed. Particles
likewise confined in a narrow channel show a generic upstream flux in
Poiseuille flow: chiral swimming is not required.

    <title>How Interactions Control Molecular Transport in Channels</title>
    <summary>  The motion of molecules across channels is critically important for
understanding mechanisms of cellular processes. Here we investigate the
mechanism of interactions in the molecular transport by analyzing exactly
solvable discrete stochastic models. It is shown that the strength and spatial
distribution of molecule/channel interactions can strongly modify the particle
current. Our analysis indicates that the most optimal transport is achieved
when the binding sites are near the entrance or exit of the pore. In addition,
the role of intermolecular interactions is studied, and it is argued that an
increase in flux can be observed for some optimal interaction strength. The
mechanism of these phenomena is discussed.

    <title>On applications of Ulam-Hyers stability in biology and economics</title>
    <summary>  We argue that Ulam-Hyers stability concept is quite significant in realistic
problems in numerical analysis, biology and economics. A generalization to
nonlinear systems is proposed and applied to the logistic equation (both
differential and difference), SIS epidemic model, Cournot model in economics
and a reaction diffusion equation. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time Ulam-Hyers stability is considered from the applications point of
view.

    <title>Realization and Properties of Biochemical-Computing Biocatalytic XOR
  Gate Based on Signal Change</title>
    <summary>  We consider a realization of the XOR logic gate in a system involving two
competing biocatalytic reactions, for which the logic-1 output is defined by
these two processes causing a change in the optically detected signal. A model
is developed for describing such systems in an approach suitable for evaluation
of the analog noise amplification properties of the gate and optimization of
its functioning. The initial data are fitted for gate quality evaluation within
the developed model, and then modifications are proposed and experimentally
realized for improving the gate functioning.

    <title>Motion Parallax is Asymptotic to Binocular Disparity</title>
    <summary>  Researchers especially beginning with (Rogers &amp; Graham, 1982) have noticed
important psychophysical and experimental similarities between the
neurologically different motion parallax and stereopsis cues. Their
quantitative analysis relied primarily on the "disparity equivalence"
approximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral
translation satisfies a strong ("asymptotic") approximation to binocular
disparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense
that it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension
to peripheral vision of (Cormac &amp; Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central
vision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic
formula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where
less precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the
vision literature.

    <title>There's plenty of time for evolution</title>
    <summary>  Objections to Darwinian evolution are often based on the time required to
carry out the necessary mutations. Seemingly, exponential numbers of mutations
are needed. We show that such estimates ignore the effects of natural
selection, and that the numbers of necessary mutations are thereby reduced to
about $K\log{L}$, rather than $K^L$, where $L$ is the length of the genomic
"word", and $K$ is the number of possible "letters" that can occupy any
position in the word. The required theory makes contact with the theory of
radix-exchange sorting in theoretical computer science, and the asymptotic
analysis of certain sums that occur there.

is going to be implemented for calculations in Phylogeny by means of the
MrBayes tool. It has a friendly interface developed with the Gridsphere
framework. The user is able to define the parameters for doing the Bayesian
calculation, determine the model of evolution, check the accuracy of the
results in the intermediate stages as well as do a multiple alignment of the
sequences previously to the final result. To do this, no knowledge from his/her
side about the computational procedure is required.

    <title>DNA Circuits Based on Isothermal Constrained Loop Extension DNA
  Amplification</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we first describe the isothermal constrained loop extension
DNA amplification (ICLEDA), which is a new variant of amplification combining
the advantages of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and of strand displacement
amplification (SDA). Then, we formalize this process in terms of the theory of
formal languages and show, on the basis of this formulation, how to manage OR
and AND gates. We then explain how to introduce negation, which allows us to
prove that, in principle, it is possible to implement the computation of any
boolean function on DNA strands using ICLEDA.

    <summary>  Here is suggested a solution to the accommodation-vergence mismatch problem
in 3D stereoscopic displays. It can be achieved by compensating the mismatched
focal length with refractive power of adjustable-focus 3D glasses. The
compensation would make vergence of human eyes match with position of virtual
stereoscopic motion pictures, reducing visual fatigue.

    <title>A neuroeconomic theory of bidirectional synaptic plasticity and
  addiction</title>
    <summary>  Neuronal mechanisms underlying addiction have been attracting attention in
neurobiology, economics, neuropsychiatry, and neuroeconomics. This paper
proposes a possible link between economic theory of addiction (Becker and
Murphy, 1988) and neurobiological theory of bidirectional synaptic plasticity
(Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro, 1982) based on recent findings in neuroeconomics
and neurobiology of addiction. Furthermore, it is suggested that several
neurobiological substrates such as cortisol (a stress hormone), NMDA and AMPA
receptors/subunits and intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic neurons are
critical factors determining parameters in Becker and Murphy's economic theory
of addiction. Future directions in the application of the theory to studies in
neuroeconomics and neuropsychiatry of addiction and its relation to stress at
the molecular level are discussed.

    <title>Theoretical frameworks for neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice</title>
    <summary>  Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics,
econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have
mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic
inconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been
extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent
advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice
have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in
intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the
new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice.
The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations
of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine,
cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.

    <title>Mean Exit Time and Escape Probability for a Tumor Growth System under
  Non-Gaussian Noise</title>
    <summary>  Effects of non-Gaussian $\alpha-$stable L\'evy noise on the Gompertz tumor
growth model are quantified by considering the mean exit time and escape
probability of the cancer cell density from inside a safe or benign domain. The
mean exit time and escape probability problems are formulated in a
differential-integral equation with a fractional Laplacian operator. Numerical
simulations are conducted to evaluate how the mean exit time and escape
probability vary or bifurcates when $\alpha$ changes. Some bifurcation
phenomena are observed and their impacts are discussed.

    <title>A classification scheme of Amino Acids in the Genetic Code by Group
  Theory</title>
    <summary>  We derive the amino acid assignment to one codon representation (typical
64-dimensional irreducible representation) of the basic classical Lie
superalgebra osp(5|2) from biochemical arguments. We motivate the approach of
mathematical symmetries to the classification of the building constituents of
the biosphere by analogy of its success in particle physics and chemistry. The
model enables to calculate polarity and molecular volume of amino acids to a
good approximation.

    <title>Using Mimicry to Learn about Mental Representations</title>
    <summary>  Phonology typically describes speech in terms of discrete signs like
features. The field of intonational phonology uses discrete accents to describe
intonation and prosody. But, are such representations useful? The results of
mimicry experiments indicate that discrete signs are not a useful
representation of the shape of intonation contours. Human behaviour seems to be
better represented by a attractors where memory retains substantial fine detail
about an utterance. There is no evidence that discrete abstract representations
that might be formed that have an effect on the speech that is subsequently
produced. This paper also discusses conditions under which a discrete phonology
can arise from an attractor model and why - for intonation - attractors can be
inferred without the implying a discrete phonology.

    <title>On Cyclic DNA Codes</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers cyclic DNA codes of arbitrary length over the ring
$R=\F_2[u]/u^4-1$. A mapping is given between the elements of $R$ and the
alphabet $\{A,C,G,T\}$ which allows the additive stem distance to be extended
to this ring. Cyclic codes over $R$ are designed such that their images under
the mapping are also cyclic or quasi-cyclic of index 2. The additive distance
and hybridization energy are functions of the neighborhood energy.

    <title>Theoretical Considerations on Compensation of the Accommodation-Vergence
  Mismatch by Refractive Power of Focus-Adjustable 3D Glasses</title>
    <summary>  The accommodation-vergence mismatch has been considered as a cause of the
visual fatigue induced in watching 3D display. We would propose the mismatch
can be compensated by refractive power of adjustable-focus 3D glasses. From
lens optics and geometrical considerations, we also developed equations that
calculate required refractive power of the 3D glasses. The compensation we
proposed is supposed to reduce the visual fatigue of 3D display.

    <title>Diagonalizing the genome II: toward possible applications</title>
    <summary>  In a previous paper, we showed that the orientable cover of the moduli space
of real genus zero algebraic curves with marked points is a compact aspherical
manifold tiled by associahedra, which resolves the singularities of the space
of phylogenetic trees. In this draft of a sequel, we construct a related
(stacky) resolution of a space of real quadratic forms, and suggest, perhaps
without much justification, that systems of oscillators parametrized by such
objects may may provide useful models in genomics.

    <title>Horizontal symmetry in the algebraic approach of genetic code</title>
    <summary>  Using concepts of physics of elementary particles concerning the breaking of
symmetry and grannd unified theory we propose to study with the algebraic
approximation the degeneracy finded in the genetic code with the incorporation
of a horizontal symmetry used in gauge theories to fit the contents of the
multiplets of the genetic code. It is used the algebraic approch of Hornos et.
al. \cite{main,PRL71,PRE,MPLB}. We propose an example for the incorporation of
horizontal symmetry to study mixtures of elements of the multiplets.

    <title>The Social Maintenance of Cooperation through Hypocrisy</title>
    <summary>  Cooperation is widespread in human societies, but its maintenance at the
group level remains puzzling if individuals benefit from not cooperating.
Explanations of the maintenance of cooperation generally assume that
cooperative and non-cooperative behavior in others can be assessed and copied
accurately. However, humans have a well known capacity to deceive and thus to
manipulate how others assess their behavior. Here, we show that hypocrisy -
claiming to be acting cooperatively while acting selfishly - can maintain
social cooperation because it prevents the spread of selfish behavior. We
demonstrate this effect both theoretically and experimentally. Hypocrisy allows
the cooperative strategy to spread by taking credit for the success of the
non-cooperative strategy.

    <summary>  In this little vision paper we analyze the human immune system from a
computer science point of view with the aim of understanding the architecture
and features that allow robust, effective behavior to emerge from local sensing
and actions. We then recall the notion of fractionated cyber-physical systems,
and compare and contrast this to the immune system. We conclude with some
challenges.

    <title>Lagerkvist versus Crick</title>
    <summary>  Present day data allow significant reconsideration of ideas on mechanisms
underlying the degeneracy in the genetic code. Here a hypothesis is presented
which links the degeneracy to possible conformational alterations in the
codon-anticodon duplex. This enables explanation of Rumer symmetry in the table
of the genetic code, coding of methionine and tryptophane without degeneracy
and predict significant difference between thymine and uracyl. The suggested
hypothesis has something in common with Lagerkvist idea that only two
nucleotides in codon are coding.

    <title>Entropy, biological evolution and the psychological arrow of time</title>
    <summary>  We argue that in Universes where future and past differ only by the entropy
content a psychological arrow of time pointing in the direction of entropy
increase can arise from natural selection in biological evolution. We show that
this effect can be demonstrated in very simple toy computer simulations of
evolution in an entropy increasing or decreasing environment.

    <title>Doing Things Twice: Strategies to Identify Studies for Targeted
  Validation</title>
    <summary>  The "reproducibility crisis" has been a highly visible source of scientific
controversy and dispute. Here, I propose and review several avenues for
identifying and prioritizing research studies for the purpose of targeted
validation. Of the various proposals discussed, I identify scientific data
science as being a strategy that merits greater attention among those
interested in reproducibility. I argue that the tremendous potential of
scientific data science for uncovering high-value research studies is a
significant and rarely discussed benefit of the transition to a fully
open-access publishing model.

appeared in the EMBO Journal, 19 Oct 2016. It was intended as an update on
comments from the late 1990s regarding use of preprints by biologists (or lack
thereof), but may be of interest to practitioners of other disciplines. It is
based largely on a keynote presentation I gave to the ASAPbio inaugural meeting
in Feb 2016, and responds as well to some follow-up questions.

    <title>Essential Facts on the History of Hyperthermia and their Connections
  with Electromedicine</title>
    <summary>  The term hyperthermia is a combination of two Greek words: HYPER (rise) and
THERME (heat) and refers to the increasing of body temperature or selected
tissues in order to achieve a precise therapeutic effect. This paper reviews
the development of thermotherapy by describing the most important moments in
its history. For decades, the development of hyperthermia ran parallel with the
development of cancer treatment and had numerous connections with
electromedicine. Throughout its history, hyperthermia evoked a number of hopes,
brought spectacular successes, but also was the subject of many
disappointments.

    <title>Complex Systems Analysis of Cell Cycling Models in Carcinogenesis</title>
    <summary>  Carcinogenesis is a complex process that involves dynamically inter-connected
modular sub-networks that evolve under the influence of micro-environmentally
induced perturbations, in non-random, pseudo-Markov chain processes. An
appropriate n-stage model of carcinogenesis involves therefore n-valued Logic
treatments of nonlinear dynamic transformations of complex functional genomes
and cell interactomes. Lukasiewicz Algebraic Logic models of genetic networks
and signaling pathways in cells are formulated in terms of nonlinear dynamic
systems with n-state components that allow for the generalization of previous,
Boolean or "fuzzy", logic models of genetic activities in vivo. Such models are
then applied to cell transformations during carcinogenesis based on very
extensive genomic transcription and translation data from the CGAP databases
supported by NCI. Such models are represented in a Lukasiewicz-Topos with an
n-valued Lukasiewicz Algebraic Logics subobject classifier description that
represents non-random and nonlinear network activities as well as their
transformations in carcinogeness. Specific models for different types of cancer
are then derived from representations of the dynamic state-space of LT
non-random, pseudo-Markov chain process, network models in terms of cDNA and
proteomic, high throughput analyses by ultra-sensitive techniques. This novel
theoretical analysis is based on extensive CGAP genomic data for human tumors,
as well as recently published studies of cyclin signaling. Several such
specific models suggest novel clinical trials and rational therapies of cancer
through re-establishment of cell cycling inhibition in stage III cancers.

    <title>Emergence of Complex Dynamics in a Simple Model of Signaling Networks</title>
    <summary>  A variety of physical, social and biological systems generate complex
fluctuations with correlations across multiple time scales. In physiologic
systems, these long-range correlations are altered with disease and aging. Such
correlated fluctuations in living systems have been attributed to the
interaction of multiple control systems; however, the mechanisms underlying
this behavior remain unknown. Here, we show that a number of distinct classes
of dynamical behaviors, including correlated fluctuations characterized by
$1/f$-scaling of their power spectra, can emerge in networks of simple
signaling units. We find that under general conditions, complex dynamics can be
generated by systems fulfilling two requirements: i) a ``small-world'' topology
and ii) the presence of noise. Our findings support two notable conclusions:
first, complex physiologic-like signals can be modeled with a minimal set of
components; and second, systems fulfilling conditions (i) and (ii) are robust
to some degree of degradation, i.e., they will still be able to generate
$1/f$-dynamics.

    <title>Elasticities and stabilities: lipid membranes vs cell membranes</title>
    <summary>  A cell membrane can be simply regarded as composite material consisting of
lipid bilayer, membrane cytoskeleton beneath lipid bilayer, and proteins
embedded in lipid bilayer and linked with membrane cytoskeleton if one only
concerns its mechanical properties. In this Chapter, above all, the authors
give a brief introduction to some important work on mechanical properties of
lipid bilayers following Helfrich's seminal work on spontaneous curvature
energy of lipid bilayers. Next, the entropy of a polymer confined in a curved
surface and the free energy of membrane cytoskeleton are obtained by scaling
analysis. It is found that the free energy of cell membranes has the form of
the in-plane strain energy plus Helfrich's curvature energy. The equations to
describe equilibrium shapes and in-plane strains of cell membranes by osmotic
pressures are obtained by taking the first order variation of the total free
energy containing the elastic free energy, the surface tension energy and the
term induced by osmotic pressure. The stability of spherical cell membrane is
discussed and the critical pressure is found to be much larger than that of
spherical lipid bilayer without membrane cytoskeleton. Lastly, the authors try
to extend the present static mechanical model of cell membranes to the cell
structure dynamics by proposing a group of coupling equations involving
tensegrity architecture of cytoskeleton, fluid dynamics of cytoplasm and
elasticities of cell membranes.

    <title>SARS oubreaks in Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore: the role of diagnosis
  and isolation as a control mechanism</title>
    <summary>  In this article we use global and regional data from the SARS epidemic in
conjunction with a model of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, and
recovered classes of people (``SEIJR'') to extract average properties and rate
constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario
(Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions
are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current
effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for
Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto,
Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between
March 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\it significant} slowing in the number
of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic
rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best
estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto,
although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model.
It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission,
SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that
computed for some strains of influenza \cite{CC2}. Although it would not be
surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than ten per cent in some
regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed
heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the
long-term impact of SARS.

    <title>The Basic Reproductive Number of Ebola and the Effects of Public Health
  Measures: The Cases of Congo and Uganda</title>
    <summary>  Despite improved control measures, Ebola remains a serious public health risk
in African regions where recurrent outbreaks have been observed since the
initial epidemic in 1976. Using epidemic modeling and data from two
well-documented Ebola outbreaks (Congo 1995 and Uganda 2000), we estimate the
number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the absence of control
interventions ($R_0$). Our estimate of $R_0$ is 1.83 (SD 0.06) for Congo (1995)
and 1.34 (SD 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via
an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a
smooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put
in place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number
$R_0$ to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also
analyze the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions
begin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control
measures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and
contact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a
factor of 2 relative the final size with a two-week delay in their
implementation.

    <title>Prediction and predictability of global epidemics: the role of the
  airline transportation network</title>
    <summary>  The systematic study of large-scale networks has unveiled the ubiquitous
presence of connectivity patterns characterized by large scale heterogeneities
and unbounded statistical fluctuations. These features affect dramatically the
behavior of the diffusion processes occurring on networks, determining the
ensuing statistical properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this
paper, we investigate the role of the large scale properties of the airline
transportation network in determining the global evolution of emerging disease.
We present a stochastic computational framework for the forecast of global
epidemics that considers the complete world-wide air travel infrastructure
complemented with census population data. We address two basic issues in global
epidemic modeling: i) We study the role of the large scale properties of the
airline transportation network in determining the global diffusion pattern of
emerging diseases; ii) We evaluate the reliability of forecasts and outbreak
scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission
and traffic flows. In order to address these issues we define a set of novel
quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and
predictability of the epidemic pattern. These measures may be used for the
analysis of containment policies and epidemic risk assessment.

    <title>Reading Sequences of Interspike Intervals in Biological Neural Circuits</title>
    <summary>  Sensory systems pass information about an animal's environment to higher
nervous system units through sequences of action potentials. When these action
potentials have essentially equivalent waveforms, all information is contained
in the interspike intervals (ISIs) of the spike sequence. We address the
question: How do neural circuits recognize and read these ISI sequences?
  Our answer is given in terms of a biologically inspired neural circuit that
we construct using biologically realistic neurons. The essential ingredients of
the ISI Reading Unit (IRU) are (i) a tunable time delay circuit modelled after
one found in the anterior forebrain pathway of the birdsong system and (ii) a
recently observed rule for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. We present a circuit
that can both learn the ISIs of a training sequence using inhibitory synaptic
plasticity and then recognize the same ISI sequence when it is presented on
subsequent occasions. We investigate the ability of this IRU to learn in the
presence of two kinds of noise: jitter in the time of each spike and random
spikes occurring in the ideal spike sequence. We also discuss how the circuit
can be detuned by removing the selected ISI sequence and replacing it by an ISI
sequence with ISIs drawn from a probability distribution.
  We have investigated realizations of the time delay circuit using
Hodgkin-Huxley conductance based neurons connected by realistic excitatory and
inhibitory synapses. Our models for the time delay circuit are tunable from
about 10 ms to 100 ms allowing one to learn and recognize ISI sequences within
that range of ISIs. ISIs down to a few ms and longer than 100 ms are possible
with other intrinsic and synaptic currents in the component neurons.

    <title>Impact of Climate Change on Forests in India</title>
    <summary>  Global assessments have shown that future climate change is likely to
significantly impact forest ecosystems. The present study makes an assessment
of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This
assessment is based on climate projections of Regional Climate Model of the
Hadley Centre (HadRM3) using the A2 (740 ppm CO2) and B2 (575 ppm CO2)
scenarios of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios and the BIOME4 vegetation
response model. The main conclusion is that under the climate projection for
the year 2085, 77% and 68% of the forested grids in India are likely to
experience shift in forest types under A2 and B2 scenario, respectively.
Indications are a shift towards wetter forest types in the northeastern region
and drier forest types in the northwestern region in the absence of human
influence. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate warming could
also result in a doubling of net primary productivity under the A2 scenario and
nearly 70% increase under the B2 scenario. The trends of impacts could be
considered as robust but the magnitudes should be viewed with caution, due to
the uncertainty in climate projections. Given the projected trends of likely
impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems, it is important to incorporate
climate change consideration in forest sector long-term planning process.

    <title>Optimal strategies for fighting persistent bugs</title>
    <summary>  Some microbial organisms are known to randomly slip into and out of
hibernation, irrespective of environmental conditions [1]. In a (genetically)
uniform population a typically very small subpopulation becomes metabolically
inactive whereas the majority subpopulation remains active and grows. Bacteria
such as E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-superbug), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3] show persistence. It can render
bacteria less vulnerable in adverse environments [1, 4, 5] and their effective
eradication through medication more difficult [2, 3, 6]. Here we show that
medication treatment regimes may have to be modified when persistence is taken
into account and characterize optimal approaches assuming that the total
medication dose is constrained. The determining factors are cumulative
toxicity, eradication power of the medication and bacterial response
timescales. Persistent organisms have to be fought using tailored eradication
strategies which display two fundamental characteristics. Ideally, the
treatment time should be significantly longer than in the case of persistence
with the medication uniformly spread out over time; however, if treatment time
has to be limited, then the application of medication has to be concentrated
towards the beginning and end of the treatment. These findings deviate from
current clinical practice, and may therefore help to optimize and simplify
treatments. Our use of multi-objective optimization [7] to map out the optimal
strategies can be generalized to other related problems.

    <title>Straub tail, the deprivation effect and addiction to aggression</title>
    <summary>  It has been observed that male mice who are consistently winning fights with
conspecifics can raise their tail, which is very similar to a morphine-induced
Straub tail response. Since this response is a typical index of opiate
activation, it has been proposed that the opioidergic systems of such mice are
chronically activated. This activation appeared to be a potent factor, which
leads to addiction to aggression. To check this hypothesis, we exposed the mice
who had won 20 fights in succession with conspecifics to a behavioral
sensitization procedure. The effects of the mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the behavior of winners were examined in an open-field test
before and after 5- and 14-day deprivation of aggression. Morphine had a much
stronger stimulating effect on the open-field behavior of 60 % of the winners
deprived of aggression for 14 days than on that of the control mice. Morphine
did not stimulate behavioral activity in the winners before or after
deprivation for 5 days. The aggression level in the winners was higher after
than before deprivation. It has been concluded that, in the winners, the
mu-opioid receptors became tolerant to the effects of morphine and became
sensitized after long aggression deprivation. The development of addiction to
aggression due to repeated victories is discussed in the light of the theory of
addiction (Robinson,Berridge, 2003).

    <title>Shorelines of islands of tractability: Algorithms for parsimony and
  minimum perfect phylogeny haplotyping problems</title>
    <summary>  The problem Parsimony Haplotyping (PH) asks for the smallest set of
haplotypes which can explain a given set of genotypes, and the problem Minimum
Perfect Phylogeny Haplotyping (MPPH) asks for the smallest such set which also
allows the haplotypes to be embedded in a perfect phylogeny, an evolutionary
tree with biologically-motivated restrictions. For PH, we extend recent work by
further mapping the interface between ``easy'' and ``hard'' instances, within
the framework of (k,l)-bounded instances where the number of 2's per column and
row of the input matrix is restricted. By exploring, in the same way, the
tractability frontier of MPPH we provide the first concrete, positive results
for this problem, and the algorithms underpinning these results offer new
insights about how MPPH might be further tackled in the future. In addition, we
construct for both PH and MPPH polynomial time approximation algorithms, based
on properties of the columns of the input matrix. We conclude with an overview
of intriguing open problems in PH and MPPH.

    <title>Bistable equilibrium points of mercury body burden</title>
    <summary>  In the last century mercury levels in the global environment have tripled as
a result of increased pollution from industrial, occupational, medicinal and
domestic uses \cite{BaMe03}. Glutathione is known to be the main agent
responsible for the excretion of mercury (we refer to \cite{Thim05},
\cite{ZalBar99} and \cite{Lyn02}). It has also been shown that mercury inhibits
glutathione synthetase (an enzyme acting in the synthesization of Glutathione),
therefore leading to decreased glutathione levels
  (we refer to \cite{Thim05}, \cite{GeGe05}, \cite{GeGe06} and \cite{RDeth04}).
Mercury also interferes with the production of heme in the porphyrin pathway
\cite{WoMaEc93}. Heme is needed for biological energy production and ability to
detox organic toxins via the P450 enzymes \cite{Boy06}. The purpose of this
paper is to show that body's response to mercury exposure is hysteretic, i.e.
when this feedback of mercury on its main detoxifying agents is strong enough
then mercury body burden has two points of equilibrium: one with normal
abilities to detoxify and low levels of mercury and one with inhibited
abilities to detoxify and high levels of mercury. Furthermore, a small increase
of body's mercury burden may not be sufficient to trigger observable neurotoxic
effects but it may be sufficient to act as a switch leading to an accumulation
of mercury in the body through environmental exposure until its toxicity
becomes manifest.

    <title>Genetic Code as a Harmonic System</title>
    <summary>  In a certain way, this paper presents the continuation of the previous one
which discussed the harmonic structure of the genetic code (Rakocevic, 2004).
Several new harmonic structures presented in this paper, through specific unity
and coherence, together with the previously presented (Rakocevic, 2004), show
that it makes sense to understand genetic code as a set of several different
harmonic structures. Thereby, the harmonicity itself represents a specific
unity and coherence of physico-chemical properties of amino acid molecules and
the number of atoms and/or nucleons in the molecules themselves (in the form of
typical balances). A specific Gauss' arithmetical algorithm has the central
position among all these structures and it corresponds to the patterns of the
number of atoms within the side chains of amino acid molecules in the following
sense: G+V = 11; P+I = 21; S+T+L+A+G = 31; D+E+M+C+P = 41; K+R+Q+N+V = 61;
F+Y+W+H+I = 71; (L+M+Q+W) + (A+C+N+H) = 81; (S+D+K+F) + (T+E+R+Y) = 91;
(F+L+M+S+P) = (T+A+Y+H+I) = (Q+N+K+D+V) = (E+C+W+R+G) = 51. Bearing in mind all
these regularities it make sense to talk about genetic code as a harmonic
system. On the other hand, such an order provides new evidence supporting the
hypothesis established in the previous paper (Rakocevic, 2004) that genetic
code has been complete from the very beginning and as such was the condition
for the origin and evolution of life.

    <title>A successive sub-grouping method for multiple sequence alignments
  analysis</title>
    <summary>  A novel approach to protein multiple sequence alignment is discussed:
substantially this method counterparts with substitution matrix based methods
(like Blosum or PAM based methods), and implies a more deterministic approach
to chemical/physical sub-grouping of amino acids . Amino acids (aa) are divided
into sub-groups with successive derivations, that result in a clustering based
on the considered property. The properties can be user defined or chosen
between default schemes, like those used in the analysis described here.
Starting from an initial set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they
are successively divided on the basis of their polarity/hydrophobic index, with
increasing resolution up to four level of subdivision. Other schemes of
subdivision are possible: in this thesis work it was employed also a scheme
based on physical/structural properties (solvent exposure, lateral chain
mobility and secondary structure tendency), that have been compared to the
chemical scheme with testing purposes. In the method described in this chapter,
the total score for each position in the alignment accounts for different
degree of similarity between amino acids. The scoring value result form the
contribution of each level of selectivity for every individual property
considered. Simply the method (called M_Al) analyse the n sequence alignment
position per position and assigns a score which have contributes by aa identity
plus a composed valuation of the chemical or of the structural affinity between
the n aligned amino acids. This method has been implemented in a series of
programs written in python language; these programs have been tested in some
biological cases, with benchmark purposes.

    <title>Mutual information in random Boolean models of regulatory networks</title>
    <summary>  The amount of mutual information contained in time series of two elements
gives a measure of how well their activities are coordinated. In a large,
complex network of interacting elements, such as a genetic regulatory network
within a cell, the average of the mutual information over all pairs &lt;I&gt; is a
global measure of how well the system can coordinate its internal dynamics. We
study this average pairwise mutual information in random Boolean networks
(RBNs) as a function of the distribution of Boolean rules implemented at each
element, assuming that the links in the network are randomly placed. Efficient
numerical methods for calculating &lt;I&gt; show that as the number of network nodes
N approaches infinity, the quantity N&lt;I&gt; exhibits a discontinuity at parameter
values corresponding to critical RBNs. For finite systems it peaks near the
critical value, but slightly in the disordered regime for typical parameter
variations. The source of high values of N&lt;I&gt; is the indirect correlations
between pairs of elements from different long chains with a common starting
point. The contribution from pairs that are directly linked approaches zero for
critical networks and peaks deep in the disordered regime.

    <title>Partition test and sexual motivation in male mice</title>
    <summary>  Theoretical analysis of own and literature investigations of sexual
motivation with the use of the partition test [Kudryavtseva, 1987, 1994] in
male mice was carried out. It has been shown that appearance of a receptive
female in the neighboring compartment of common cage separated by perforated
transparent partition produces the enhancement of testosterone level in blood
and stimulates the behavioral activity near partition as a reaction to the
receptive female in naive males. In many studies this behavioral activity is
considered as sexual motivation, arising in this experimental context in male
mice. The lack of correlation between behavioral parameters and gonad reaction
of males on receptive female, uninterconnected changes of these two parameters
as well as the lack of sexual behavior between naive male and female when
partition is removed cast doubt on this data interpretation. It has been
supposed that in naive males behavioral reaction to a receptive female is
induced by positive incentive - odor of the female associated with nursing and
warmth from mother and other females which look after posterity. Short-term
increase of the level of testosterone (possessing rewarding properties) is
innate stimulus-response reaction which stimulates and prolongs behavioral
interest of male to receptive female. It has been supposed that after sexual
experience female odor is associated in experienced males with sexual behavior
directed to the sexual partner and resulted in the formation of sexual
motivation. The data are considered also in the light of the theory of
motivated behavior including "liking", "wanting" and "learning" [Robinson and
Berridge, 1993, 2000].

    <title>Size-independent differences between the mean of discrete stochastic
  systems and the corresponding continuous deterministic systems</title>
    <summary>  In this paper I show that, for a class of reaction networks, the discrete
stochastic nature of the reacting species and reactions results in qualitative
and quantitative differences between the mean of exact stochastic simulations
and the prediction of the corresponding deterministic system. The differences
are independent of the number of molecules of each species in the system under
consideration. These reaction networks are open systems of chemical reactions
with no zero-order reaction rates systems. They are characterized by at least
two stationary points, one of which is a nonzero stable point, and one unstable
trivial solution (stability based on a linear stability analysis of the
deterministic system). Starting from a nonzero initial condition, the
deterministic system never reaches the zero stationary point due to its
unstable nature. In contrast, the result presented here proves that this
zero-state is the only stable stationary state for the discrete stochastic
system. This result generalizes previous theoretical studies and simulations of
specific systems and provides a theoretical basis for analyzing a class of
systems that exhibit such inconsistent behavior. This result has implications
in the simulation of infection, apoptosis, and population kinetics, as it can
be shown that for certain models the stochastic simulations will always yield
different predictions for the mean behavior than the deterministic simulations.

    <title>Nemo: a computational tool for analyzing nematode locomotion</title>
    <summary>  The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to an impressive range of
chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli and is extensively used to investigate
the molecular mechanisms that mediate chemosensation, mechanotransduction and
thermosensation. The main behavioral output of these responses is manifested as
alterations in animal locomotion. Monitoring and examination of such
alterations requires tools to capture and quantify features of nematode
movement. In this paper, we introduce Nemo (nematode movement), a
computationally efficient and robust two-dimensional object tracking algorithm
for automated detection and analysis of C. elegans locomotion. This algorithm
enables precise measurement and feature extraction of nematode movement
components. In addition, we develop a Graphical User Interface designed to
facilitate processing and interpretation of movement data. While, in this
study, we focus on the simple sinusoidal locomotion of C. elegans, our approach
can be readily adapted to handle complicated locomotory behaviour patterns by
including additional movement characteristics and parameters subject to
quantification. Our software tool offers the capacity to extract, analyze and
measure nematode locomotion features by processing simple video files. By
allowing precise and quantitative assessment of behavioral traits, this tool
will assist the genetic dissection and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
underlying specific behavioral responses.

    <title>Biological Organization and Negative Entropy: Based on Schroedinger's
  reflections</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a systemic perspective for some aspects of both
phylogenesis and ontogenesis, in the light of the notion of biological
organization as negative entropy, following some hints by Schroedinger. To this
purpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are
(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no
meaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be
then extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider
far from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of
global entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A
close analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion
equation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a
tool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for
his equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the
operatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real
coefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of
quantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple
mathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over
complexity, as for evolution. We then elaborate, from the existence of
different time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy
and negative entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze
metabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant
coefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.
Finally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,
also in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).

    <title>Predictability and epidemic pathways in global outbreaks of infectious
  diseases: the SARS case study</title>
    <summary>  Background: The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
epidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range
transportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks.
The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an
important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism.
Methods: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that
incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220
countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of
country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by
the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of
robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread
of the disease. Results: In order to assess the predictive power of the model,
the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease
parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from
empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is
evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in
agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. Conclusions:
The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range
mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power
that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational
strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and
forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of
containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic
outbreaks.

    <title>Matrix genetics, part 1: permutations of positions in triplets and
  symmetries of genetic matrices</title>
    <summary>  The Kronecker family of the genetic matrices is investigated, which is based
on the genetic matrix [C T; A G], where C, T, A, G are the letters of the
genetic alphabet. The matrix [C T; A G] in the second Kronecker power is the
(4*4)-matrix of 16 duplets. The matrix [C T; A G] in the third Kronecker power
is the (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets. It is significant that peculiarities of the
degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white
mosaic of these genetic matrices. The article represents interesting
mathematical properties of these mosaic matrices, which are connected with
positional permutations inside duplets and triplets; with projector operators;
with unitary matrices and cyclic groups, etc. Fractal genetic nets are proposed
as a new effective tool to study long nucleotide sequences. Some results about
revealing new symmetry principles of long nucleotide sequences are described.

    <title>Iron Behaving Badly: Inappropriate Iron Chelation as a Major Contributor
  to the Aetiology of Vascular and Other Progressive Inflammatory and
  Degenerative Diseases</title>
    <summary>  The production of peroxide and superoxide is an inevitable consequence of
aerobic metabolism, and while these particular "reactive oxygen species" (ROSs)
can exhibit a number of biological effects, they are not of themselves
excessively reactive and thus they are not especially damaging at physiological
concentrations. However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can
lead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl
radical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic
inflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the
involvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a
large number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and
inflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation
of cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many
similarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e.
iron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The
studies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic
and neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and
lesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and
longevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is
thus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As
systems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have
multiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent
patterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of
multiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the
decidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...

    <title>Existence of biological uncertainty principle implies that we can never
  find 'THE' measure for biological complexity</title>
    <summary>  There are innumerable 'biological complexity measure's. While some patterns
emerge from these attempts to represent biological complexity, a single measure
to encompass the seemingly countless features of biological systems, still
eludes the students of Biology. It is the pursuit of this paper to discuss the
feasibility of finding one complete and objective measure for biological
complexity. A theoretical construct (the 'Thread-Mesh model') is proposed here
to describe biological reality. It segments the entire biological space-time in
a series of different biological organizations before modeling the property
space of each of these organizations with computational and topological
constructs. Acknowledging emergence as a key biological property, it has been
proved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological
complexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of
biological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an
expression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological
reality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two
theorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer
dependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons
behind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity
measure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore
provides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and
biological reality.

    <title>A new simulation-based model for calculating post-mortem intervals using
  developmental data for Lucilia sericata (Dipt.: Calliphoridae)</title>
    <summary>  Homicide investigations often depend on the determination of a minimum
post-mortem interval (PMI$_{min}$) by forensic entomologists. The age of the
most developed insect larvae (mostly blow fly larvae) gives reasonably reliable
information about the minimum time a person has been dead. Methods such as
isomegalen diagrams or ADH calculations can have problems in their reliability,
so we established in this study a new growth model to calculate the larval age
of \textit{Lucilia sericata} (Meigen 1826). This is based on the actual
non-linear development of the blow fly and is designed to include
uncertainties, e.g. for temperature values from the crime scene. We used
published data for the development of \textit{L. sericata} to estimate
non-linear functions describing the temperature dependent behavior of each
developmental state. For the new model it is most important to determine the
progress within one developmental state as correctly as possible since this
affects the accuracy of the PMI estimation by up to 75%. We found that PMI
calculations based on one mean temperature value differ by up to 65% from PMIs
based on an 12-hourly time temperature profile. Differences of 2\degree C in
the estimation of the crime scene temperature result in a deviation in PMI
calculation of 15 - 30%.

    <title>Vaccination against rubella: Analysis of the temporal evolution of the
  age-dependent force of infection and the effects of different contact
  patterns</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we analyze the temporal evolution of the age-dependent force
of infection and incidence of rubella, after the introduction of a very
specific vaccination programme in a previously nonvaccinated population where
rubella was in endemic steady state. We deduce an integral equation for the
age-dependent force of infection, which depends on a number of parameters that
can be estimated from the force of infection in steady state prior to the
vaccination program. We present the results of our simulations, which are
compared with observed data. We also examine the influence of contact patterns
among members of a community on the age-dependent intensity of transmission of
rubella and on the results of vaccination strategies. As an example of the
theory proposed, we calculate the effects of vaccination strategies for four
communities from Caieiras (Brazil), Huixquilucan (Mexico), Finland and the
United Kingdom. The results for each community differ considerably according to
the distinct intensity and pattern of transmission in the absence of
vaccination. We conclude that this simple vaccination program is not very
efficient (very slow) in the goal of eradicating the disease. This gives
support to a mixed strategy, proposed by Massad et al., accepted and
implemented by the government of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

    <title>Mechanics of Reversible Unzipping</title>
    <summary>  We study the mechanics of a reversible decohesion (unzipping) of an elastic
layer subjected to quasi-static end-point loading. At the micro level the
system is simulated by an elastic chain of particles interacting with a rigid
foundation through breakable springs. Such system can be viewed as prototypical
for the description of a wide range of phenomena from peeling of polymeric
tapes, to rolling of cells, working of gecko's fibrillar structures and
denaturation of DNA. We construct a rigorous continuum limit of the discrete
model which captures both stable and metastable configurations and present a
detailed parametric study of the interplay between elastic and cohesive
interactions. We show that the model reproduces the experimentally observed
abrupt transition from an incremental evolution of the adhesion front to a
sudden complete decohesion of a macroscopic segment of the adhesion layer. As
the microscopic parameters vary the macroscopic response changes from
quasi-ductile to quasi-brittle, with corresponding decrease in the size of the
adhesion hysteresis. At the micro-scale this corresponds to a transition from a
`localized' to a `diffuse' structure of the decohesion front (domain wall). We
obtain an explicit expression for the critical debonding threshold in the limit
when the internal length scales are much smaller than the size of the system.
The achieved parametric control of the microscopic mechanism can be used in the
design of new biological inspired adhesion devices and machines.

    <title>Complete Human Mitochondrial Genome Construction Using L-systems</title>
    <summary>  Recently, scientists from The Craig J. Venter Institute reported construction
of very long DNA molecules using a variety of experimental procedures adopting
a number of working hypotheses. Finding a mathematical rule for generation of
such a long sequence would revolutionize our thinking on various advanced areas
of biology, viz. evolution of long DNA chains in chromosomes, reasons for
existence of long stretches of non-coding regions as well as would usher
automated methods for long DNA chains preparation for chromosome engineering.
However, this mathematical principle must have room for editing / correcting
DNA sequences locally in those areas of genomes where mutation and / or DNA
polymerase has introduced errors over millions of years. In this paper, we
report the basics and applications of L-system (a mathematical principle) which
could answer all the aforesaid issues. At the end, we present the whole human
mitochondrial genome which has been generated using this mathematical principle
using PC computation power. We can claim now that we can make any stretch of
DNA, be it 936 bp of olfactory receptor, with or without introns, mitochondrial
DNA to 3 x 109 bp DNA sequences of the whole human genome with even a PC
computation power.

    <title>Anxiety as a Factor in the Development of Autistic Spectrum Symptoms: an
  Experimental Study</title>
    <summary>  It is well known that psychoemotional disorders may be accompanied by
decreased sociability in humans. It has been shown that repeated social defeats
in 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the
expressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the
elevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social
interactions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory
activity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of
approaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming
behavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5
mg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in
the elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the
partition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the
level of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of
approaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is
concluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated
male mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social
behavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is
supposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular
mechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative
social experiences.

    <title>Characterization of the norepinephrine-activation of adenylate cyclase
  suggests a role in memory affirmation pathways. Overexposure to epinephrine
  inactivates adenylate-cyclase,a causal pathway for stress-pathologies</title>
    <summary>  Incubation with noradrenaline (norepinephrine) of isolated membranes of rat's
brain corpus striatum and cortex, showed that ionic-magnesium (Mg2+) is
required for the neurotransmitter activatory response of Adenylate Cyclase [ATP
pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), (EC 4.6.1.1)], AC.An Mg2+-dependent response
to the activatory effects of adrenaline, and subsequent inhibition by calcium,
suggest capability for a turnover, associated with cyclic changes in membrane
potential and participation in a short term-memory pathway.In the cell, the
neurotransmitter by activating AC generates intracellular cyclic AMP. Calcium
entrance in the cell inhibits the enzyme. The increment of cyclic AMP activates
kinaseA and their protein phosphorylating activity, allowing a long term memory
pathway. Hence, consolidating neuronal circuits, related to emotional learning
and memory affirmation.The activatory effect relates to an enzyme-noradrenaline
complex which may participate on the physiology of the fight or flight
response, by prolonged exposure. However, the persistence of an unstable enzyme
complex turns the enzyme inactive. Effect concordant, with the observation that
prolonged exposure to adrenaline, participate in the etiology of stress
triggered pathologies. At the cell physiological level AC responsiveness to
hormones could be modulated by the concentration of Chelating Metabolites.
These ones produce the release of free ATP4-, a negative modulator of AC and
the Mg2+ activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK). Thus, allowing an
integration of the hormonal response of both enzymes by ionic controls. This
effect could supersede the metabolic feedback control by energy-charge.
Accordingly, maximum hormonal response of both enzymes, to high Mg2+ and low
free ATP4-, allows a correlation with the known effects of low caloric intake
increasing average life expectancy.

    <title>The Virtual Institute for Integrative Biology (VIIB)</title>
    <summary>  The Virtual Institute for Integrative Biology (VIIB) is a Latin American
initiative for achieving global collaborative e-Science in the areas of
bioinformatics, genome biology, systems biology, metagenomics, medical
applications and nanobiotechnolgy. The scientific agenda of VIIB includes:
construction of databases for comparative genomics, the AlterORF database for
alternate open reading frames discovery in genomes, bioinformatics services and
protein simulations for biotechnological and medical applications. Human
resource development has been promoted through co-sponsored students and shared
teaching and seminars via video conferencing. E-Science challenges include:
interoperability and connectivity concerns, high performance computing
limitations, and the development of customized computational frameworks and
flexible workflows to efficiently exploit shared resources without causing
impediments to the user. Outreach programs include training workshops and
classes for high school teachers and students and the new Adopt-a-Gene
initiative. The VIIB has proved an effective way for small teams to transcend
the critical mass problem, to overcome geographic limitations, to harness the
power of large scale, collaborative science and improve the visibility of Latin
American science It may provide a useful paradigm for developing further
e-Science initiatives in Latin America and other emerging regions.

    <title>The genetic code, 8-dimensional hypercomplex numbers and dyadic shifts</title>
    <summary>  Matrix forms of the representation of the multi-level system of
molecular-genetic alphabets have revealed algebraic properties of this system.
Families of genetic (4*4)- and (8*8)-matrices show unexpected connections of
the genetic system with Walsh functions and Hadamard matrices, which are known
in theory of noise-immunity coding, digital communication and digital
holography. Dyadic-shift decompositions of such genetic matrices lead to sets
of sparse matrices. Each of these sets is closed in relation to multiplication
and defines relevant algebra of hypercomplex numbers. It is shown that genetic
Hadamard matrices are identical to matrix representations of Hamilton
quaternions and its complexification in the case of unit coordinates. The
diversity of known dialects of the genetic code is analyzed from the viewpoint
of the genetic algebras. An algebraic analogy with Punnett squares for
inherited traits is shown. Our results are used in analyzing genetic phenomena.
The statement about existence of the geno-logic code in DNA and epigenetics on
the base of the spectral logic of systems of Boolean functions is put forward.
Our results show promising ways to develop algebraic-logical biology, in
particular, in connection with the logic holography on Walsh functions.

    <title>Length, Weight, and Yield in Channel Catfish, Lake Diane, MI</title>
    <summary>  Background: Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) are important to both
commercial aquaculture and recreational fisheries. Little published data is
available on length-weight relationships of channel catfish in Michigan. Though
there is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in
Lake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent
fishery. Results: NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and
a = 0.00522. The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b,
and a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm. Estimates of uncertainty and
covariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient
is r = 0.995 in both cases. LLS regression produced different parameter values,
a = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.
On average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown
et al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight
suggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989. Conclusion: Most of
the fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th
percentile for their length. Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and
the population is well matched to the food supply. Management should attempt to
maintain current population levels. In this case, the improved length-weight
model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and
smaller covariance than the traditional model.

    <title>Genetic Code: Four Diversity Types of Protein Amino Acids</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents, for the first time, four diversity types of protein
amino acids. The first type includes two amino acids (G, P), both without
standard hydrocarbon side chains; the second one four amino acids, as two pairs
[(A, L), (V, I)], all with standard hydrocarbon side chains; the third type
comprises the six amino acids, as three pairs [(F, Y), (H, W), (C, M)], two
aromatic, two hetero aromatic and two "hetero" non-aromatic); finally, the
fourth type consists of eight amino acids, as four pairs [(S, T), (D, E), (N,
Q), (K, R)], all with a functional group which also exists in amino acid
functional group (wholly presented: H2N-\.CH-COOH; separately: OH, COOH, CONH2,
NH2). The insight into existence of four types of diversity was possible only
after an insight into the existence of some very new arithmetical regularities,
which were so far unknown. Also, as for showing these four types was necessary
to reveal the relationships between several key harmonic structures of the
genetic code (which we presented in our previous works), this paper is also a
review article of the author's researches of the genetic code. By this, the
review itself shows that the said harmonic structures are connected through the
same (or near the same) chemically determined amino acid pairs, 10 pairs out of
the 190 possible.

    <title>Dynamical modeling of collective behavior from pigeon flight data: flock
  cohesion and dispersion</title>
    <summary>  Several models of flocking have been promoted based on simulations with
qualitatively naturalistic behavior. In this paper we provide the first direct
application of computational modeling methods to infer flocking behavior from
experimental field data. We show that this approach is able to infer general
rules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or,
more generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing
pigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent
attraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to
explain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals
over time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of
building complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior.
Topological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the
components within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with
simulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek
model. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show
that the more complex three dimensional models are capable of predicting and
simulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics.
The simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of
the collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the
initial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach
may be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and
collective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement.
From these models, the behavior of the individual agents (animals) may be
inferred.

    <title>Systematic Approach on Differences in Avian Viral Proteins Based on
  Carbon Composition</title>
    <summary>  The distribution of amino acid along the protein sequences plays an
imperative role in facilitating different biological functions. Currently,
there is insufficient scientific data, which represents the arrangement of
amino acid in the proteins based on atomic composition. Our deep observational
and analytical studies indicate that the distribution of carbon in the protein
sequence can bring differences in the function of proteins. Until now, it is
believed that carbon content elicits the hydrophobic interactions in proteins.
This distinct feature classifies normal proteins and viral proteins based on
the carbon content. One of the objectives of this investigation is to show the
significance of carbon composition in protein structure evaluation. Since, the
level of perceived benefit is likely to be high in the field of proteomics for
structural analysis, the position of this paper is to prioritize only the avian
viral protein sequences based on carbon content when compared with the normal
protein sequences. Here, we present the evaluation of carbon along the avian
protein sequence in order to show the differences in the distribution of carbon
using the software technology. The evaluation results provide a deep view in to
the molecular structure of avian viral protein, which can further enable the
progress of research in the proteomics domain based on carbon classification.
This systematic approach in computing carbon level of avian viruses aim towards
the benefit of individual, regional and global health in addition to opening of
further effective research on avian viral protein based on the aforementioned
results

    <title>Field-control, phase-transitions, and life's emergence</title>
    <summary>  Instances of critical-like characteristics in living systems at each
organizational level as well as the spontaneous emergence of computation
(Langton), indicate the relevance of self-organized criticality (SOC). But
extrapolating complex bio-systems to life's origins, brings up a paradox: how
could simple organics--lacking the 'soft matter' response properties of today's
bio-molecules--have dissipated energy from primordial reactions in a controlled
manner for their 'ordering'? Nevertheless, a causal link of life's macroscopic
irreversible dynamics to the microscopic reversible laws of statistical
mechanics is indicated via the 'functional-takeover' of a soft magnetic
scaffold by organics (c.f. Cairns-Smith's 'crystal-scaffold'). A
field-controlled structure offers a mechanism for bootstrapping--bottom-up
assembly with top-down control: its super-paramagnetic components obey
reversible dynamics, but its dissipation of H-field energy for aggregation
breaks time-reversal symmetry. The responsive adjustments of the controlled
(host) mineral system to environmental changes would bring about mutual
coupling between random organic sets supported by it; here the generation of
long-range correlations within organic (guest) networks could include SOC-like
mechanisms. And, such cooperative adjustments enable the selection of the
functional configuration by altering the inorganic network's capacity to assist
a spontaneous process. A non-equilibrium dynamics could now drive the
kinetically-oriented system towards a series of phase-transitions with
appropriate organic replacements 'taking-over' its functions.

    <title>Influenza Virus Vaccine Efficacy Based On Conserved Sequence Alignment</title>
    <summary>  The rapid outbreak of bird flu challenges the outcome of effective vaccine
for the upcoming years. The recent research established different norms to
eliminate flu pandemics. This can be made possible with skilled experimental
analyses and by tracking the recent virulent strain and can be broadly
applicable with effective testing of vaccine efficacy. Every year World Health
Organization (WHO) reveals the administration of drug and vaccine to counter
arrest the spread of flu among the population. As there are recurrent failures
in priming the population, the complete eradication of the flu pandemic is
still appears to be an unresolved problem. To overcome the current scenario,
high level efforts with theoretical and practical research is required and it
can enhance the scope in this field. The recent advancements also allow the
researchers to endeavor effective vaccine to meet the emerging flu types. Only
the standardized vaccination among the population at the time of flu pandemics
will revolutionalize the current propositions against influenza virus. This
paper shows the deficiencies of vaccine fitness research as there are reported
failures and less efficacy of vaccine even after priming the population from
referred evidences and studies. It also shows simple experimental approach in
detecting the effective vaccine among the vaccines announced by WHO.

    <title>Living Devices</title>
    <summary>  The physiological tradition of biological research analyzes biological
systems using reduced descriptions much as an engineer uses a 'black box'
description of an amplifier. Simple models have been used by physiologists for
a very long time. Physiologists have successfully analyzed a broad range of
biological systems using a 'device-oriented' approach similar to the approach
an engineer would use to investigate her devices. The present generation views
biology through the powerful lenses of structural and (molecular) dynamic
analysis, understandably enough because of the beauty and power of the
analysis, and the ease of using these structures with present freely available
software. The problem is that these powerful lenses offer such magnification
that the engineering approach cannot be seen. High magnification means limited
field of view, because the (spatial) dynamic range cannot cover everything. The
function of the structures and molecular dynamics cannot be seen in the work of
many biologists, probably because function cannot be immediately seen in the
structures and molecular dynamics they compute. It is just as important for
biologists to measure the inputs and outputs of their systems as it is to
measure their structures. It seems clear, at least to one physiologist, that
this research will be catalyzed by assuming that most biological systems are
devices that can be analyzed with the same strategies one would use to analyze
engineering devices. Thinking today about your biological preparation as a
device tells you what experiments to do tomorrow. An important task for many of
us is to transmit the physiological tradition to the next generation of
biophysicists to help them adapt traditional questions to the new length scales
and techniques of molecular and atomic biology.

    <title>Life's Solutions are Complex Fluids. A Mathematical Challenge</title>
    <summary>  Classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics describe systems in which
nothing interacts with nothing. Even the highly refined theory of simple fluids
does not deal very well with electrical interactions, boundary conditions, or
flows, if at all. Electrical interactions, boundary conditions, and flows are
essential features of living systems. Life without flow is death and so a
different approach is needed to study biology alive. The theory of complex
fluids deals with interactions, boundary conditions, and flows quite well as
can be seen in its successful treatment of liquid crystals. I advocate treating
ionic solutions in general as complex fluids, with microelements that are the
solutes and components of the solution. Enzyme active sites are a special case
where some solutes are reactants. Solutes are crowded into active sites of
enzyme by the high density of protein charges. The electric field links
chemical reactions to charges in the protein and surrounding solutions.
Interactions potentiate catalysis and control biological function. I suspect
that most chemical reactions that occur in liquids also need to be treated by
the theory of complex fluids. The electron movements of these reactions occur
in a temporary highly concentrated fluctuation, a transient spatial
inhomogeneity in the bulk solution. The electron movements of these reactions
(described by quantum mechanics) are coupled to the electric (and sometimes
steric) fields of the bulk solution. I suspect the electron movements,
inhomogeneities, and chemical reaction (in the condensed phase) need to be
treated by the theory of complex fluids because everything interacts with
everything else, in this system, as in so many others.

    <title>A Theoretical Mechanism of Szilard Engine Function in Nucleic Acids and
  the Implications for Quantum Coherence in Biological Systems</title>
    <summary>  Nucleic acids theoretically possess a Szilard engine function that can
convert the energy associated with the Shannon entropy of molecules for which
they have coded recognition, into the useful work of geometric reconfiguration
of the nucleic acid molecule. This function is logically reversible because its
mechanism is literally and physically constructed out of the information
necessary to reduce the Shannon entropy of such molecules, which means that
this information exists on both sides of the theoretical engine, and because
information is retained in the geometric degrees of freedom of the nucleic acid
molecule, a quantum gate is formed through which multi-state nucleic acid
qubits can interact. Entangled biophotons emitted as a consequence of symmetry
breaking nucleic acid Szilard engine (NASE) function can be used to coordinate
relative positioning of different nucleic acid locations, both within and
between cells, thus providing the potential for quantum coherence of an entire
biological system. Theoretical implications of understanding biological systems
as such "quantum adaptive systems" include the potential for multi-agent based
quantum computing, and a better understanding of systemic pathologies such as
cancer, as being related to a loss of systemic quantum coherence.

    <title>Hydrogen magnetic reaction gene regulation</title>
    <summary>  A new gene regulation system using weak magnetic field can induce the
hydrogen magnetic reaction (HMR) in hydrogen atoms, and subsequently affect the
electrostatic polarity of hydrogen bonds in DNA base pairs. The HMR can
sequentially activate the DNA base pair polarities of target DNA. With the
characteristic base pair polarities of DNA duplex the (pyrimidine)m-(purine)n
DNA segment is a basic unit to maintain and to accumulate the electrostatic
energy of DNA duplex (1). To enhance the polarities of objective DNA this HMR
gene regulation (HMR-GR) uses the polarized magnetic field with optimal
nucleotide exposure time for T:A and C:G base pairs (50 msec and 80 msec,
respectively). The targeting efficiency of HMR-GR to the objective DNA is
theoretically up to 25%. In the present study, the HMR-GR expanded the
conformation of oligo-dsDNA in vitro, implicating the active state of DNA, and
also enhanced the restriction endonuclease digestion, in vitro RNA
transcription, and the production of green fluorescence protein and
{\beta}-galactosidase by using each RE site sequence and relevant promoter
sequence, respectively. Taken together, it is assumed that the HMR-GR is an
effective and safe method to control the multiple genes sequentially by
activating their specific DNA motifs.

    <title>General law of growth and replication. Growth equation and its
  applications</title>
    <summary>  We present significantly advanced studies of the previously introduced
physical growth mechanism and unite it with biochemical growth factors.
Obtained results allowed formulating the general growth law which governs
growth and evolutional development of all living organisms, their organs and
systems. It was discovered that the growth cycle is predefined by the
distribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass
production. This distribution is quantitatively defined by the growth ratio
parameter, which depends on the geometry of an organism, phase of growth and,
indirectly, organism's biochemical machinery. The amount of produced biomass,
in turn, defines the composition of biochemical reactions. Changing amount of
nutrients diverted to biomass production is what forces organisms to proceed
through the whole growth and replication cycle. The growth law can be
formulated as follows: the rate of growth is proportional to influx of
nutrients and growth ratio. Considering specific biochemical components of
different organisms, we find influxes of required nutrients and substitute them
into the growth equation; then, we compute growth curves for amoeba, wild type
fission yeast, fission yeast's mutant. In all cases, predicted growth curves
correspond very well to experimental data. Obtained results prove validity and
fundamental scientific value of the discovery.

    <title>The genetic code, algebra of projection operators and problems of
  inherited biological ensembles</title>
    <summary>  This article is devoted to applications of projection operators to simulate
phenomenological properties of the molecular-genetic code system. Oblique
projection operators are under consideration, which are connected with matrix
representations of the genetic coding system in forms of the Rademacher and
Hadamard matrices. Evidences are shown that sums of such projectors give
abilities for adequate simulations of ensembles of inherited biological
phenomena including ensembles of biological cycles, morphogenetic ensembles of
phyllotaxis patterns, mirror-symmetric patterns, etc. For such modeling, the
author proposes multidimensional vector spaces, whose subspaces are under a
selective control (or coding) by means of a set of matrix operators on base of
genetic projectors. Development of genetic biomechanics is discussed. The
author proposes and describes special systems of multidimensional numbers under
names united-hypercomplex numbers, which attracted his attention when he
studied genetic systems and genetic matrices. New rules of long nucleotide
sequences are described on the base of the proposed notion of tetra-groups of
equivalent oligonucleotides. Described results can be used for developing
algebraic biology, bio-technical applications and some other fields of science
and technology.

    <title>Designing the statistically optimal drug for cancer therapy</title>
    <summary>  Cancer and healthy cells have distinct distributions of molecular properties
and thus respond differently to drugs. Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells
while limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among
cells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of
selective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the
idea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and
healthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to
discriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then
how the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular
markers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs
to tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to
discriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We
also find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs,
suggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In
agreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy
well. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and
predicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the
individual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a
discrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers
promises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails.

    <title>A Model of Teneral Dehydration in Glossina</title>
    <summary>  The results of a long-established investigation into teneral transpiration
are used as a rudimentary data set. These data are not complete in that all are
at 25 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and the temperature-dependence cannot, therefore be
resolved. An allowance is, nonetheless, made for the outstanding
temperature-dependent data. The data are generalised to all humidities, levels
of activity and, in theory, temperatures, by invoking the property of
multiplicative separability. In this way a formulation, which is a very simple,
first order, ordinary differential equation, is devised. The model is extended
to include a variety of Glossina species by resorting to their relative,
resting water loss rates in dry air. The calculated, total water loss is
converted to the relevant humidity, at 24 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, that which
produced an equivalent water loss in the pupa, in order to exploit an adaption
of an established survival relationship. The resulting computational model
calculates total, teneral water loss, consequent mortality and adult
recruitment. Surprisingly, the postulated race against time, to feed, applies
more to the mesophilic and xerophilic species, in that increasing order. So
much so that it is reasonable to conclude that, should Glossina brevipalpis
survive the pupal phase, it will almost certainly survive to locate a host,
without there being any significant prospect of death from dehydration. With
the conclusion of this work comes the revelation that the classification of
species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely true only in so
much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the hours shortly
before eclosion.

    <title>Dynamics and Control of an Invasive Species: The Case of the Rasberry
  Crazy Ant Colonies</title>
    <summary>  This project is motivated by the costs related with the documented risks of
the introduction of non-native invasive species of plants, animals, or
pathogens associated with travel and international trade. Such invasive species
often have no natural enemies in their new regions. The spatiotemporal dynamics
related to the invasion/spread of Nylanderia fulva, commonly known as the
Rasberry crazy ant, are explored via the use of models that focus on the
reproduction of ant colonies. A Cellular Automaton (CA) simulates the spatially
explicit spread of ants on a grid. The impact of local spatial correlations on
the dynamics of invasion is investigated numerically and analytically with the
aid of a Mean Field (MF) model and a Pair Approximation (PA) model, the latter
of which accounts for adjacent cell level efects. The PA model approach
considers the limited mobility range of N. fulva, that is, the grid cell
dynamics are not strongly in uenced by non-adjacent cells. The model determines
the rate of growth of colonies of N. fulva under distinct cell spatial
architecture. Numerical results and qualitative conclusions on the spread and
control of this invasive ant species are discussed.

    <title>A Quantum Model on Chemically-Physically Induced Pluripotency in Stem
  Cells</title>
    <summary>  A quantum model on the chemically and physically induced pluripotency in stem
cells is proposed. Based on the conformational Hamiltonian and the idea of slow
variables (molecular torsions) slaving fast ones the conversion from the
differentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the quantum transition
between conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an
analytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the
rate on the number of torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate
can be estimated by comparison with protein folding. The reaction equations of
the conformational change of the pluripotency genes in chemical reprogramming
are given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated
and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition
rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape
of the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that
by decreasing the coherence degree of some pluripotency genes a more effective
approach to the physically induced pluripotency can be made.

    <title>Local dynamic stability of treadmill walking: intrasession and
  week-to-week repeatability</title>
    <summary>  Repetitive falls degrade the quality of life of elderly people and of
patients suffering of various neurological disorders. In order to prevent falls
while walking, one should rely on relevant early indicators of impaired dynamic
balance. The local dynamic stability (LDS) represents the sensitivity of gait
to small perturbations: divergence exponents (maximal Lyapunov exponents)
assess how fast a dynamical system diverges from neighbor points. Although
numerous findings attest the validity of LDS as a fall risk index, reliability
results are still sparse. The present study explores the intrasession and
intersession repeatability of gait LDS using intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Ninety-five healthy
individuals performed 5min. treadmill walking in two sessions separated by 9
days. Trunk acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer. Three time
scales were used to estimate LDS: over 4 to 10 strides ({\lambda}4-10), over
one stride ({\lambda}1) and over one step ({\lambda}0.5). The intrasession
repeatability was assessed from three repetitions of either 35 strides or 70
strides taken within the 5min tests. The intersession repeatability compared
the two sessions, which totalized 210 strides. The intrasession ICCs
(70-strides estimates/35-strides estimates) were 0.52/0.18 for {\lambda}4-10
and 0.84/0.77 for {\lambda}1 and {\lambda}0.5. The intersession ICCs were
around 0.60. The SEM results revealed that {\lambda}0.5 measured in
medio-lateral direction exhibited the best reliability, sufficient to detect
moderate changes at individual level (20%). However, due to the low
intersession repeatability, one should average several measurements taken on
different days in order to better approximate the true LDS.

    <title>Foundations of biology</title>
    <summary>  It is often stated that there are no laws in biology, where everything is
contingent and could have been otherwise, being solely the result of historical
accidents. Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological
entities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors
remains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive
reasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the
logical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present
article describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations
of biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the
language and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach
assumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends
discipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised
through the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and
asymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these
four concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.
Four fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's
theory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes
Mendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism
and deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts
of natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their
reproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to
clarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major
theories. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the origin
of life, of system and synthetic biology, and of artificial life.

    <title>Technological integration and hyper-connectivity: Tools for promoting
  extreme human lifespans</title>
    <summary>  Artificial, neurobiological, and social networks are three distinct complex
adaptive systems (CAS), each containing discrete processing units (nodes,
neurons, and humans respectively). Despite the apparent differences, these
three networks are bound by common underlying principles which describe the
behaviour of the system in terms of the connections of its components, and its
emergent properties. The longevity (long-term retention and functionality) of
the components of each of these systems is also defined by common principles.
Here, I will examine some properties of the longevity and function of the
components of artificial and neurobiological systems, and generalise these to
the longevity and function of the components of social CAS. In other words, I
will show that principles governing the long-term functionality of computer
nodes and of neurons, may be extrapolated to the study of the long-term
functionality of humans (or more precisely, of the noemes, an abstract
combination of existence and digital fame). The study of these phenomena can
provide useful insights regarding practical ways that can be used in order to
maximize human longevity. The basic law governing these behaviours is the Law
of Requisite Usefulness, which states that the length of retention of an agent
within a CAS is proportional to the contribution of the agent to the overall
adaptability of the system. Key Words: Complex Adaptive Systems,

    <title>Stem Cell Transplantation As A Dynamical System: Are Clinical Outcomes
  Deterministic?</title>
    <summary>  Outcomes in stem cell transplantation (SCT) are modeled using probability
theory. However the clinical course following SCT appears to demonstrate many
characteristics of dynamical systems, especially when outcomes are considered
in the context of immune reconstitution. Dynamical systems tend to evolve over
time according to mathematically determined rules. Characteristically, the
future states of the system are predicated on the states preceding them, and
there is sensitivity to initial conditions. In SCT, the interaction between
donor T cells and the recipient may be considered as such a system in which,
graft source, conditioning and early immunosuppression profoundly influence
immune reconstitution over time. This eventually determines clinical outcomes,
either the emergence of tolerance or the development of graft versus host
disease. In this paper parallels between SCT and dynamical systems are explored
and a conceptual framework for developing mathematical models to understand
disparate transplant outcomes is proposed.

    <title>Cybernetic Principles of Aging and Rejuvenation: the
  buffering-challenging strategy for life extension</title>
    <summary>  Aging is analyzed as the spontaneous loss of adaptivity and increase in
fragility that characterizes dynamic systems. Cybernetics defines the general
regulatory mechanisms that a system can use to prevent or repair the damage
produced by disturbances. According to the law of requisite variety,
disturbances can be held in check by maximizing buffering capacity, range of
compensatory actions, and knowledge about which action to apply to which
disturbance. This suggests a general strategy for rejuvenating the organism by
increasing its capabilities of adaptation. Buffering can be optimized by
providing sufficient rest together with plenty of nutrients: amino acids,
antioxidants, methyl donors, vitamins, minerals, etc. Knowledge and the range
of action can be extended by subjecting the organism to an as large as possible
variety of challenges. These challenges are ideally brief so as not to deplete
resources and produce irreversible damage. However, they should be sufficiently
intense and unpredictable to induce an overshoot in the mobilization of
resources for damage repair, and to stimulate the organism to build stronger
capabilities for tackling future challenges. This allows them to override the
trade-offs and limitations that evolution has built into the organism's repair
processes in order to conserve potentially scarce resources. Such acute,
"hormetic" stressors strengthen the organism in part via the "order from noise"
mechanism that destroys dysfunctional structures by subjecting them to strong,
random variations. They include heat and cold, physical exertion, exposure,
stretching, vibration, fasting, food toxins, micro-organisms, environmental
enrichment and psychological challenges.

    <title>LEDs for Energy Efficient Greenhouse Lighting</title>
    <summary>  Light energy is an important factor for plant growth. In regions where the
natural light source, i.e. solar radiation, is not sufficient for growth
optimization, additional light sources are being used. Traditional light
sources such as high pressure sodium lamps and other metal halide lamps are not
very efficient and generate high radiant heat. Therefore, new sustainable
solutions should be developed for energy efficient greenhouse lighting. Recent
developments in the field of light source technologies have opened up new
perspectives for sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of
light-emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs, for greenhouse lighting. This review focuses
on the potential of LEDs to replace traditional light sources in the
greenhouse. In a comparative economic analysis of traditional vs. LED lighting,
we show that the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost
of vegetables in the long-run of several years, due to the high energy
efficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity of LEDs. In order to evaluate
LEDs as a true alternative to current lighting sources, species specific plant
response to different wavelengths is discussed in a comparative study. However,
more detailed scientific studies are necessary to understand the effect of
different LED spectra on plants physiology. Technical innovations are required
to design and realize an energy efficient light source with a spectrum tailored
for optimal plant growth in specific plant species.

    <title>A Set of Discrete Formulae for the Performance of a Tsetse Population
  During Aerial Spraying</title>
    <summary>  A set of discrete formulae that calculates the hypothetical impact of aerial
spraying on a tsetse population is derived and the work is thought to be novel.
Both the original population and the subsequent generations which survive the
aerial spraying, may ultimately be thought of as deriving from two, distinct
sources. These origins are, however, neither distinct, nor relevant by the
third generation. It is for this reason that the female population is
considered to be composed of the following four categories for the purposes of
derivation: Original flies which existed as such at the commencement of
spraying; original pupae which existed as such at the commencement of spraying;
the immediate descendants of both the aforementioned categories, during
spraying; third and higher generation descendants. In theory, the latter
category is a recurrence relation. In practice, the third generation's pupal
stage has hardly come into existence, even by the end of a completed operation.
Implicit in the formulae is the assumption of one, temperature-dependent
mortality rate for the entire pupal stage, a second for the period between
eclosion and ovulation and yet a third for the entire, adult life-span. Gravid
female resistance to the insecticide is assumed to be inconsequential. A
further assumption of the formulae is that at least one male is always
available (degree of sterility variable).

    <title>The model of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle motions in the
  motility of intestinal segment</title>
    <summary>  Coordination in circular and longitudinal muscle motions are of crucial
importance in the motor function of gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Intestinal
wall motions depend on myogenic-active properties of smooth muscles layers of
intestinal wall, which is the ability to create active contractile forces in
response to distension. Considering the stress in the circular and longitudinal
smooth muscles as a sum of passive, depending on muscle deformations, and
active, depending on muscle tone, components, and also assuming that the change
in the muscle tone depends on the current stress-strain condition, the system
of four ordinary differential equations (ODE) is obtained, which describes
filling-emptying cycle of intestinal segment as a process of coordinated
activities of circular and longitudinal muscles of intestinal wall. A general
approach in formulating the modelling conditions is based on the previously
described model restricted to the circularly distensible reservoir of constant
length. Obtained results illustrate the character of coordinated activities of
two orthogonal muscle layers, which are alternating phases of reciprocally and
uniformly changing modalities such as stretching of the wall and muscle tone.
The results also contribute to the existing understanding of the roles of
Auerbach's and Meisner's intermuscular and submucous neural plexuses in
regulations of autonomous intestinal motility, as well as clarify functional
mechanisms of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in triggering of smooth
muscle contractions.

    <title>The entropic basis of collective behaviour</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we identify a radically new viewpoint on the collective
behaviour of groups of intelligent agents. We first develop a highly general
abstract model for the possible future lives that these agents may encounter as
a result of their decisions. In the context of these possible futures, we show
that the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules
that maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of
the observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human
and animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise
their future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this
cohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the
distribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social
interaction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for
both discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts
that social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of
response to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a
neurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel
basis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in
simulation studies of collective behaviour.

    <title>Selectivity filter gate versus voltage-sensitive gate: A study of
  quantum probabilities in the Hodgkin-Huxley equation</title>
    <summary>  The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is a powerful model to explain different
aspects of spike generation in excitable cells. However, the HH model was
proposed in 1952 when the real structure of the ion channel was unknown. It is
now common knowledge that in many ion-channel proteins the flow of ions through
the pore is governed by a gate, comprising a so-called selectivity filter
inside the ion channel, which can be controlled by electrical interactions. The
selectivity filter is believed to be responsible for the selection and fast
conduction of particular ions across the membrane of an excitable cell. Other
(generally larger) parts of the molecule such as the pore-domain gate control
the access of ions to the channel protein. In fact, two types of gates are
considered here for ion channels: the external gate, which is the voltage
sensitive gate, and the internal gate which is the selectivity filter gate
(SFG). Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small
dimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion
channel. Here, we examine parameters in a generalized model of HH to see
whether any parameter affects the spike generation. Our results indicate that
the previously suggested semi-quantum-classical equation proposed by Bernroider
and Summhammer (BS) agrees strongly with the HH equation under different
conditions and may even provide a better explanation in some cases. We conclude
that the BS model can refine the classical HH model substantially.

    <title>Experimental Investigation of Distant Cellular Interaction among Adipose
  Derived Stem-Cells</title>
    <summary>  In addition to chemical and mechanical interactions between cells
electromagnetic field produced by cells has been considered as another form of
signaling for cell-cell communication. The aim of this study is evaluation of
electromagnetic effects on viability of Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)
without co-culturing. In this study, stem cells were isolated from human
adipose tissue enzymatically and proliferated in monolayer culture. Then,
5.(10^4) adipose-derived stem cells were cultured in each well of the test
plate. In the first row (4 wells), ADSCs as inducer cells were cultured in
DMEM1 with 10 ng/ml Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In adjacent and the last
rows, ADSCs were cultured without FGF (as detector cells). After the three and
five days the viability of cells were evaluated. Moreover, ADSCs were cultured
in the same conditions but the inducer cells were placed once in the UV-filter
tube and once in the quartz tube to see whether there is electromagnetic
interaction among cells. Inducer cells caused significant cell proliferation in
adjacent row cells (p- value&lt;0.01) in the fifth day. However, using the
UV-filter tube and quartz tube both reduced the effect of inducer cells on
adjacent cells significantly. As a conclusion, we could detect distant cellular
interaction (DCI) among adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), but it was not
electromagnetic signaling. Our results show that ADSCs affect each other via
volatile signaling as a chemical distant cellular interaction (CDCI).

    <title>A Simulation for Neurophotonic Quantum Computation in Visual Pathways</title>
    <summary>  One of the answers to the measurement problem in quantum theory is given by
the Copenhagen-Interpretation of quantum theory (i.e. orthodox quantum theory)
in which the wave function collapse happens in (by) the mind of observer. In
fact, at first, great scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner
(initially) believed that the wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is
caused by the consciousness of observer. However, this issue has been stayed
yet very controversial. In fact, there are many challenging discussions about
the survival of quantum effects in microscopic structures of the human brain,
which is mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet
and noisy environment of the brain that forbids long life coherence for brain
processing. Nevertheless, there are also several arguments and evidences that
emergence of large coherent states is feasible in the brain. In this paper, our
approach is based on the latter in which macroscopic quantum states are
probable in the human brain. Here, we simulate the delayed luminescence of
photons in neurons with a Brassard-like teleportation circuit, i.e. equivalent
to the transfer of quantum states of photons through the visual pathways from
retina to the visual cortex. Indeed, our simulation considers both classical
and quantum mechanical aspects of processing in neurons. As a result and based
on our simulation, it is possible for our brain to receive the exact quantum
states of photons in the visual cortex to be collapsed by our consciousness,
which supports the Copenhagen-Interpretation of measurement problem in quantum
theory.

    <title>Review of Magnetic Shark Deterrents: Hypothetical Mechanisms and
  Evidence for Selectivity</title>
    <summary>  Several papers published since 2006 describe effects of magnetic fields on
elasmobranchs and assess their utility in reducing negative interactions
between sharks and humans, including bycatch reduction. Most of these repeat a
single untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs
detect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of
magnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have
magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field
detection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly
narrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that
magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates
the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.
However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several
teleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present
in many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect
magnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as
demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer
from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic
detection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies
depends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in

    <title>Measurement in biological systems from the self-organisation point of
  view</title>
    <summary>  Measurement in biological systems became a subject of concern as a
consequence of numerous reports on limited reproducibility of experimental
results. To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general
features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their
chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.
Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct
trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible
sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,
sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the
organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And
this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different
framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the
view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid
overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely
complemented. An increase of specification of experimental procedures is the
way for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system
may be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.

    <title>Traditional aging theories: which ones are useful?</title>
    <summary>  Many theories have been proposed to answer two questions on aging: "Why do we
age?" and "How do we age?" Among them, evolutionary theories are proposed to
interpret the evolutionary advantage of aging, and "saving resources for group
benefit" is thought to be the purpose of aging. However for saving resources, a
more economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who
are over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological
theories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of
aging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory,
gene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored
the influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free
radicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even
if intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated
with some but not all of the aging changes. Damage (fault)-accumulation theory
predicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging.
However, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living
organism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause
rapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on
interpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and damage
(fault)-accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the
importance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories
are useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes,
including loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure
of information-transmission. An advanced theory, which can include all of these
useful ideas in traditional theories, is needed.

    <title>Development of aging changes: self-accelerating and inhomogeneous</title>
    <summary>  Aging changes including age spots and atherosclerotic plaques develop in a
manner of in-homogeneous and accelerated. For understanding this phenomenon,
development of aging changes is analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, which is
introduced in Misrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of
repair for increasing the surviving chance of an organism in situations of
severe injuries; however a Misrepair alters the structure of a tissue, a cell
or a molecule, which are the sub-structures of an organism. II. Alteration of
the structure of a sub-structure by Misrepair also alters the spatial
relationship between local sub-structures, and this change will lead to
increased damage-sensitivity and reduced repair-efficiency of these
sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a tendency to occur to the
sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an old Misrepair has taken
place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again the damage-sensitivity of
these sub-structures and the surrounding sub-structures. The frequency of
Misrepairs to these sub-structures is increased and the range of affected
sub-structures is enlarged after each time of Misrepair in a vicious circle.
Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. III.
Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to formation and growing of a "spot"
or "plaque" in a tissue. Growing of a spot is self-accelerating, and old spots
grow faster than new ones. New spots prefer to develop close to old ones,
resulting in an in-homogenous distribution of spots. In conclusion, the
in-homogeneous development of aging changes is a result of self-accelerating
and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; thus the process of aging is
self-accelerating.

    <title>Quaternionic representation of the genetic code</title>
    <summary>  A heuristic diagram of the evolution of the standard genetic code is
presented. It incorporates, in a way that resembles the energy levels of an
atom, the physical notion of broken symmetry and it is consistent with original
ideas by Crick on the origin and evolution of the code as well as with the
chronological order of appearence of the amino acids along the evolution as
inferred from work that mixtures known experimental results with theoretical
speculations. Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based
mathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central
object in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid
an integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is
preserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of
amino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we
propose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three
dimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental
one stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical
representation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken
into account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the
genetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the
close relationship between quaternions and rotations.

    <title>Studies of unicellular micro-organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means
  of Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy</title>
    <summary>  Results of Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) and microscopic
studies on simple microorganisms: brewing yeasts are presented. Lifetime of
ortho - positronium (o-Ps) were found to change from 2.4 to 2.9 ns (longer
lived component) for lyophilised and aqueous yeasts, respectively. Also
hygroscopicity of yeasts in time was examined, allowing to check how water -
the main component of the cell - affects PALS parameters, thus lifetime of o-Ps
were found to change from 1.2 to 1.4 ns (shorter lived component) for the dried
yeasts. The time sufficient to hydrate the cells was found below 10 hours. In
the presence of liquid water an indication of reorganization of yeast in the
molecular scale was observed.
  Microscopic images of the lyophilised, dried and wet yeasts with best
possible resolution were obtained using Inverted Microscopy (IM) and
Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) methods. As a result visible
changes to the surface of the cell membrane were observed in ESEM images.

    <title>A Mathematical Model for the Genetic Code(s) Based on Fibonacci Numbers
  and their q-Analogues</title>
    <summary>  This work aims at showing the relevance and the applications possibilities of
the Fibonacci sequence, and also its q-deformed or quantum extension, in the
study of the genetic code(s). First, after the presentation of a new formula,
an indexed double Fibonacci sequence, comprising the first six Fibonacci
numbers, is shown to describe the 20 amino acids multiplets and their
degeneracy as well as a characteristic pattern for the 61 meaningful codons.
Next, the twenty amino acids, classified according to their increasing
atom-number (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur), exhibit several Fibonacci
sequence patterns. Several mathematical relations are given, describing various
atom-number patterns. Finally, a q-Fibonacci simple phenomenological model,
with q a real deformation parameter, is used to describe, in a unified way, not
only the standard genetic code, when q=1, but also all known slight variations
of this latter, when q~1, as well as the case of the 21st amino acid
(Selenocysteine) and the 22nd one (Pyrrolysine), also when q~1. As a by-product
of this elementary model, we also show that, in the limit q=0, the number of
amino acids reaches the value 6, in good agreement with old and still
persistent claims stating that life, in its early development, could have used
only a small number of amino acids.

    <title>Stephane Leduc and the vital exception in the Life Sciences</title>
    <summary>  Embryogenesis, the process by which an organism forms and develops, has long
been and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By
which means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,
and eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions
our understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific
theories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems
to have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited
long ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical
properties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc
proposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that
biology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and
life-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and
diffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to
identify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.
While Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later
acclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th
century. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical
approach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long
forsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology
increasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the
mechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our
reluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.

    <title>Roadless space is greatly diminished by logging in intact forest
  landscapes of the Congo Basin</title>
    <summary>  Forest degradation in the tropics is often associated with roads built for
selective logging. The protection of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) that are
not accessible by roads is high on the biodiversity conservation agenda, a
challenge for logging concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC). A frequently advocated conservation objective is to maximise the
retention of "roadless space", a concept that is based on distance to the
nearest road from any point. We developed a novel use of the empty space
function - a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random
sets theory - to calculate roadless space in a part of the Congo Basin where
there has recently been rapid expansion of road networks. We compared the
temporal development of roadless space in certified and non-certified logging
concessions inside and outside areas declared as IFL in the year 2000. Between
1999 and 2007, rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless
space in IFL. After 2007, this trajectory levelled out in most areas, due to an
equilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became
revegetated. However, concessions within IFL that have been certified by FSC
since around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space, thus reaching a
level comparable to all other concessions. Only national parks remained
road-free. We recommend that forest management policies make the preservation
of large connected forest areas a top priority by effectively monitoring - and
limiting - the occupation of space by roads that are permanently accessible.

    <title>A framework for philosophical biology</title>
    <summary>  Advances in biology have mostly relied on theories that were subsequently
revised, expanded or eventually refuted using experimental and other means.
Theoretical biology used to primarily provide a basis to rationally examine the
frameworks within which biological experiments were carried out and to shed
light on overlooked gaps in understanding. Today, however, theoretical biology
has generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.
This could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a
"data first", rather than a "theory first", approach is preferred. Moreover,
generating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.
This situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be
disentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology
and medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological
sciences. This paper makes the case for a "philosophical biology"
(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology
(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through
philosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of
theoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word "theory" and making
use of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural
sciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given
biological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along
with a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or
not the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be
secondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final
goal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical
framework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental

    <title>PeppyChains: Simplifying the assembly of 3D-printed generic protein
  models</title>
    <summary>  Peppytides is a coarse-grained, accurate, physical model of the polypeptide
chain. I have shared instructions to make your own polypeptide chain and STL
files of Peppytides in MAKE magazine in Jan 2014 issue. However, Peppytides
involves a lot of steps and assembly of units. People were asking me, 'Is there
any easier way to make these models?'. I have been at several workshops,
hands-on sessions, talks and a science events with Peppytides. From the
feedback that I got everywhere, most of the makers, teachers and students want
something that is 3D-Print-&amp;-Go, or at least easier to make, even at the cost
of some features.
  I have designed a new version of the model, named PeppyChains, in which the
backbone chain of the model can be 3d-printed as a single unit. PeppyChains
design eliminates the assembling of parts to form the backbone chain, but with
the cost of losing the ability to use bias-magnets to favor certain phi/psi
angles in the backbone. I have been demonstrating PeppyChains at various talks
and workshops along with Peppytides, and I have received requests for making
the STL file public. On popular demand, here I am sharing this STL and
providing the step-by-step instructions to make PeppyChains. Just add the
hydrogen-bond magnets, paint and color-code the atoms, and you are ready to go!
No drilling. No time consuming assembly.

    <title>First direct evidence of two stages in free recall and three
  corresponding estimates of working memory capacity</title>
    <summary>  I find that exactly two stages can be seen directly in sequential free recall
distributions. These distributions show that the first three recalls come from
the emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage
and the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded
step function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall
distributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory
(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads
to a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working
memory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the
second stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the
first item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,
and that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped
serial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of
the content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with
3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of
working memory. A third, separate upper limit on the capacity of working memory
is found (3.06 items), corresponding to the requirement that the content of
working memory cannot exceed the total recall, item by item. This third limit
presumably corresponds to the least chunked item. This is the best limit on the
capacity of unchunked working memory.

    <title>A Precise Measure of Working Memory Reveals Subjects Difficulties
  Managing Limited Capacity</title>
    <summary>  Free recall consists of two separate stages: the emptying of working memory
and reactivation [1]. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double
integer items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to
reactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian
college students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average
number of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item
test, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of
other qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,
indicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at
3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity
limit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered
decreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most
subjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items
increased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty
in managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any
items correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson
correlation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively
small 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have
important consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and
test design. Because working memory scores are important for academic
achievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by
learning how to manage her or his capacity limit.

    <title>Velvet Worms (Onychophora) in Folklore and Art: Geographic Pattern,
  Types of Cultural Reference and Public Perception</title>
    <summary>  Aims: To document and preserve folkloric beliefs and art inspired by velvet
worms (Onychophora), rare invertebrates that are considered "living fossils",
have full placental organs and capture prey with a rough "net" built in a
fraction of a second. Study Design: This study is a combination of field
interviews, online surveys and automatic database search. Methods: We asked
open-ended questions to farmers who know the worms, consulted experts and
searched the Internet to document folkloric and artistic instances using all
the names that these animals receive in English, Spanish and Portuguese
(languages of the countries where they occur) as well as other languages, and
automatic image search, in Web of Science, CrossRef, Google Scholar and Google.
Results: We found more than 80 cases of direct references to velvet worms in
folklore and art, mostly from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and New
Zealand. Per capita the countries with more cases are New Zealand (24 cases per
million inhabitants), Costa Rica (16 cases per million inhabitants) and
Australia (3 cases per million inhabitants). The most frequent expressions are
cartoons, followed by tourism agencies using velvet worms in their ads,
products with velvet worm representations, folkloric beliefs, and music bands
or songs named after them. In almost all cases the animals are seen in a
favorable light, inspiring folklore and art that highlight their extraordinary
nature. Conclusion: The unique prey capture mechanism of velvet worms seems to
have inspired an unexpected number of artistic and folkloric expressions,
preserved for the future in the present article, which starts a totally new
line of research: the effect of "living fossils" on human culture.

    <title>Natural calcium carbonate for biomedical applications</title>
    <summary>  Sea shells are found to be a very rich natural resource for calcium
carbonate. Sea shells are made up of CaCO3 mainly in the aragonite form, which
are columnar or fibrous or microsphere structured crystals. The bioactivity of
nanoparticles of sea shell has been studied in this work. The sea shells
collected were thoroughly washed, dried and pulverized. The powder was sieved
and particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea
shells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly
microspheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments
were conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into
the sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of
drug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in
drug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent
ultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro
drug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM
images displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The
sea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be
useful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and
39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)
was observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was
released slowly in 19 hrs. Further modification of the sea shell with non toxic
polymers is also planned as a part of this work. Sea shell powder has become a
potential candidate for drug delivery due to all the aforementioned advantages.

    <title>Permutation, Multiscale and Modified Multiscale Entropies a Natural
  Complexity for Low-High Infection Level Intracellular Viral Reaction Kinetics</title>
    <summary>  Viral infectious diseases, such as HIV virus growth, cause an important
health concern. Study of intracellular viral processes can provide us to
develop drug and understanding the drug dose to decrease the HIV virus in
during growth. Kinetics Monte Carlo simulation has been done for solving Master
equation about dynamics of intracellular viral reaction kinetics. Scaling
relationship between equilibrium time and initial population of template has
been found as power low, , where N , are the number of initial population of
template species , equilibrium time, a = 163.1 , b = -0.1429 respectively.
Stochastic dynamics shows that increasing initial population of template
decreases the time of equilibrium. Entropy generation has been considered in
low, intermediate and high infection level of intracellular viral kinetics
reaction in during dynamical process. Permutation, multi scaling and modified
multiscaling entropies have been calculated for three kinds of species in
intracellular reaction dynamics, genome, structural protein, and template. Our
result shows that presence of noise in dynamical process of intracellular
reaction will change order of permutation entropy for the mentioned of three
species. In addition to multiscaling entropy is computed for mentioned model
and it has the following order: template &gt; structural protein&gt; genome.
Dependency of permutation entropy result to permutation order becomes small in
high infection level in intracellular viral kinetics dynamics. At short time
scale in intracellular reaction dynamics, convergency of permutation entropy
occurs with medium permutation order value. In the big time scale of
intracellular dynamics, permutation entropy scale with permutation order n as a
scaling relation .

    <title>The Machine that Builds Itself: How the Strengths of Lisp Family
  Languages Facilitate Building Complex and Flexible Bioinformatic Models</title>
    <summary>  We address the need for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of
programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research.
Languages of this family, like Common Lisp, Scheme, or Clojure, facilitate the
creation of powerful and flexible software models that are required for complex
and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important
key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other
programming languages and we will explain how these features can aid
researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also
show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the
advantages of domain-specific languages (DSL): languages which are specialized
to a particular area and thus not only facilitate easier research problem
formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best
programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs
are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp
dialect, which is commonly referred to as the "programmable programming
language." We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to
build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may
ultimately transform machine learning and AI research in bioinformatics and
computational biology.

    <title>The Complexity of Molecular Interactions and Bindings between Cyclic
  Peptide and Inhibit Polymerase A and B1 (PAC-PB1N) H1N1</title>
    <summary>  The influenza/H1N1 virus has caused hazard in the public health of many
countries. Hence, existing influenza drugs could not cope with H1N1 infection
due to the high mutation rate of the virus. In this respect, new method to
block the virus was devised. The polymerase PAC-PB1N enzyme is responsible for
the replication of H1N1 virus. Thus, novel inhibitors were developed to ward
off the functionality of the enzyme. In this research, cyclic peptides has been
chosen to inhibit PAC-PB1N due to its proven stability in reaching the drug
target. Thus, computational method for elucidating the molecular interaction
between cyclic peptides and PAC-PB1N has been developed by using the LigX tools
from MOE 2008.10 software. The tools could render the bindings that involved in
the interactions. The interactions between individual amino acid in the
inhibitor and enzyme could be seen as well. Thus, the peptide sequences of
CKTTC and CKKTC were chosen as the lead compounds. In this end, the feasibility
of cyclic peptides to act as drug candidate for H1N1 could be exposed by the 2d
and 3d modeling of the molecular interactions.

    <title>Low pH, high salinity: too much for Microbial Fuel Cells?</title>
    <summary>  Twelve single chambered, air-cathode Tubular Microbial Fuel Cells (TMFCs)
have been filled up with fruit and vegetable residues. The anodes were realized
by means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a
graphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The
performances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed
according to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate
water dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,
finally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.
  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was
carried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a
Power Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$ and
a maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic
surface. COD removal after a $28-$day period was about $45 \%$.
  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very
likely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our
reactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to
actual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to
characterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the
global TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable
alternative to anaerobic digestion technologies.

    <title>A quantitative definition of organismality and its application to lichen</title>
    <summary>  The organism is a fundamental concept in biology. However there is no
universally accepted, formal, and yet broadly applicable definition of what an
organism is. Here we introduce a candidate definition. We adopt the view that
the "organism" is a functional concept, used by scientists to address
particular questions concerning the future state of a biological system, rather
than something wholly defined by that system. In this approach organisms are a
coarse-graining of a fine-grained dynamical model of a biological system.
Crucially, the coarse-graining of the system into organisms is chosen so that
their dynamics can be used by scientists to make accurate predictions of those
features of the biological system that interests them, and do so with minimal
computational burden. To illustrate our framework we apply it to a dynamic
model of lichen symbiosis---a system where either the lichen or its constituent
fungi and algae could reasonably be considered "organisms." We find that the
best choice for what organisms are in this scenario are complex mixtures of
many entities that do not resemble standard notions of organisms. When we
restrict our allowed coarse-grainings to more traditional types of organisms,
we find that ecological conditions, such as niche competition and predation
pressure, play a significant role in determining the best choice for organisms.

    <title>Interspecific allometric scaling of multicellular organisms as an
  evolutionary process of food chain creation, influenced by mechanical
  constraints</title>
    <summary>  Metabolic rate of organisms (amount of energy produced per unit time)
increases slower than organisms' mass. This phenomenon, when considered across
different taxa, is called interspecific allometric scaling. Its fundamental
causes remain unknown. We discovered that interspecific allometric scaling
occurred as the result of collective adaptation of organisms within the food
chain, influenced by mechanical constraints. It appears to be a fundamental
principle, affecting life evolution and its organization. On one hand,
organisms have to reliably acquire sufficient food for successful reproduction
of their populations. This evolutionary need enforces adaptations enhancing
metabolic power, when the size of an organism increases. On the other hand,
this advantage in metabolic power cannot be too strong - otherwise, the
populations of species in the food chain, which the organism feeds on, could be
destroyed. The counteraction of these two opposing factors establishes a
dynamic balance in the food chain and preserves its continuity. Applying this
principle, we introduce biomechanical models and obtain allometric exponents
for the maximal and basal metabolic rates considering mammals, reptiles, fish
and birds. The results correspond well to previous experimental and other
studies, which confirms validity of the discovered principle and explains the
fundamental causes of interspecific allometric scaling.

    <title>Modeling mammary organogenesis from biological first principles: Cells
  and their physical constraints</title>
    <summary>  In multicellular organisms, relations among parts and between parts and the
whole are contextual and interdependent. These organisms and their cells are
ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing
non-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These
association patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed.
This contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed
cause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these
intrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental
one that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary
gland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological
principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to
apply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or
computer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based
on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as
fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default
state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle
of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological
component, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains
collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless
constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and
ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their
ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can
be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints...

    <title>An applied mathematician's perspective on Rosennean Complexity</title>
    <summary>  The theoretical biologist Robert Rosen developed a highly original approach
for investigating the question "What is life?", the most fundamental problem of
biology. Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem
surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical
models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect
underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships
between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto "throw away
the physics, keep the organisation". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic
models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might
have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own
work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M,R)
systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach
could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the
mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate
to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a
particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions
rather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The
strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison
with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's
definition of life, "organisms are closed to efficient causation", should be
considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be
implemented in mathematical models are presented.

    <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Quantifying Biological Complexity</title>
    <summary>  One thing that discriminates living things from inanimate matter is their
ability to generate similarly complex or non-random architectures in a large
abundance. From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells,
microbial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations
in biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies.
This is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves
construct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not
living, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological
organism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The
problem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an
approach that aims to evaluate complex objects as possible biosignatures.
However, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to
explore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove
rigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In
this paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity,
that allows us to not only threshold the abiotic-biotic divide, but to
demonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity
which can be used to unambiguously assign complex objects as biosignatures. We
hope that this approach not only opens up the search for biosignatures beyond
earth, but allow us to explore earth for new types of biology, as well as
observing when a complex chemical system discovered in the laboratory could be
considered alive.

    <title>The thermodynamic efficiency of computations made in cells across the
  range of life</title>
    <summary>  Biological organisms must perform computation as they grow, reproduce, and
evolve. Moreover, ever since Landauer's bound was proposed it has been known
that all computation has some thermodynamic cost -- and that the same
computation can be achieved with greater or smaller thermodynamic cost
depending on how it is implemented. Accordingly an important issue concerning
the evolution of life is assessing the thermodynamic efficiency of the
computations performed by organisms. This issue is interesting both from the
perspective of how close life has come to maximally efficient computation
(presumably under the pressure of natural selection), and from the practical
perspective of what efficiencies we might hope that engineered biological
computers might achieve, especially in comparison with current computational
systems. Here we show that the computational efficiency of translation, defined
as free energy expended per amino acid operation, outperforms the best
supercomputers by several orders of magnitude, and is only about an order of
magnitude worse than the Landauer bound. However this efficiency depends
strongly on the size and architecture of the cell in question. In particular,
we show that the {\it useful} efficiency of an amino acid operation, defined as
the bulk energy per amino acid polymerization, decreases for increasing
bacterial size and converges to the polymerization cost of the ribosome. This
cost of the largest bacteria does not change in cells as we progress through
the major evolutionary shifts to both single and multicellular eukaryotes.
However, the rates of total computation per unit mass are nonmonotonic in
bacteria with increasing cell size, and also change across different biological
architectures including the shift from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes.

    <title>The lunar cycle's influence on sex determination at conception in humans</title>
    <summary>  The lunar cycle has long been suspected to influence biological phenomena.
Folklore alludes to such a relationship, but previous scientific analyses have
failed to find significant associations. It has been shown that lunar cycles
indeed have effects on animals; significant associations between human
circadian rhythms and lunar cycles have also been reported. We set out to
determine whether a significant statistical correlation exists between the
lunar phase and sex determination during conception. We found that significant
associations (\textit{p}-value $&lt; 5 \times 10^{-5}$) exist between the average
sex ratio (male:female) and the lunar month. The likelihood of conception of a
male is at its highest point five days after the full moon, whereas the highest
likelihood of female conception occurs nineteen days after the full moon.
Furthermore, we found that the strength of this influence is correlated with
the amount of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight). Our results
suggest that sex determination may be influenced by the moon cycle, which
suggests the possibility of lunar influence on other biological phenomena. We
suggest for future research the exploration of similar effects in other
phenomena involving humans and other species.

    <title>Evaluation of Microencapsulation of The UFV-AREG1 Bacteriophage in
  Alginate-Ca Microcapsules using Microfluidic Devices</title>
    <summary>  The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the emergence of resistant
microorganisms have become a major challenge for the food industry. The purpose
of this work was to microencapsulate the bacteriophage UFV-AREG1 in a calcium
alginate matrix using microfluidic devices and to study the viability and
efficiency of retention. The microcapsules were added to gel of propylene
glycol for use as an antimicrobial in the food industry. The technique showed
the number of the phage encapsulation, yielding drops with an average 100-250
$\mu$m of diameter, 82.1 $\pm$ 2% retention efficiency and stability in the gel
matrix for 21 days. The gel added to the microencapsulated phage showed
efficiency (not detectable on the surface) in reducing bacterial contamination
on the surface at a similar level to antimicrobial chemicals (alcohol 70%).
Therefore, it was possible to microencapsulate bacteriophages in alginate-Ca
and apply the microcapsules in gels for use as sanitizers in the food industry.

    <title>Towards physical principles of biological evolution</title>
    <summary>  Biological systems reach organizational complexity that far exceeds the
complexity of any known inanimate objects. Biological entities undoubtedly obey
the laws of quantum physics and statistical mechanics. However, is modern
physics sufficient to adequately describe, model and explain the evolution of
biological complexity? Detailed parallels have been drawn between statistical
thermodynamics and the population-genetic theory of biological evolution. Based
on these parallels, we outline new perspectives on biological innovation and
major transitions in evolution, and introduce a biological equivalent of
thermodynamic potential that reflects the innovation propensity of an evolving
population. Deep analogies have been suggested to also exist between the
properties of biological entities and processes, and those of frustrated states
in physics, such as glasses. We extend such analogies by examining
frustration-type phenomena, such as conflicts between different levels of
selection, in biological evolution. We further address evolution in
multidimensional fitness landscapes from the point of view of percolation
theory and suggest that percolation at level above the critical threshold
dictates the tree-like evolution of complex organisms. Taken together, these
multiple connections between fundamental processes in physics and biology imply
that construction of a meaningful physical theory of biological evolution might
not be a futile effort.

    <title>Nonlinear brain dynamics as macroscopic manifestation of underlying
  many-body field dynamics</title>
    <summary>  Neural activity patterns related to behavior occur at many scales in time and
space from the atomic and molecular to the whole brain. Here we explore the
feasibility of interpreting neurophysiological data in the context of many-body
physics by using tools that physicists have devised to analyze comparable
hierarchies in other fields of science. We focus on a mesoscopic level that
offers a multi-step pathway between the microscopic functions of neurons and
the macroscopic functions of brain systems revealed by hemodynamic imaging. We
use electroencephalographic (EEG) records collected from high-density electrode
arrays fixed on the epidural surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas in
rabbits and cats trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS) in the
various modalities. High temporal resolution of EEG signals with the Hilbert
transform gives evidence for diverse intermittent spatial patterns of amplitude
(AM) and phase modulations (PM) of carrier waves that repeatedly re-synchronize
in the beta and gamma ranges at near zero time lags over long distances. The
dominant mechanism for neural interactions by axodendritic synaptic
transmission should impose distance-dependent delays on the EEG oscillations
owing to finite propagation velocities. It does not. EEGs instead show evidence
for anomalous dispersion: the existence in neural populations of a low velocity
range of information and energy transfers, and a high velocity range of the
spread of phase transitions. This distinction labels the phenomenon but does
not explain it. In this report we explore the analysis of these phenomena using
concepts of energy dissipation, the maintenance by cortex of multiple ground
states corresponding to AM patterns, and the exclusive selection by spontaneous
breakdown of symmetry (SBS) of single states in sequences.

    <title>Modeling the Worldwide Spread of Pandemic Influenza: Baseline Case and
  Containment Interventions</title>
    <summary>  We present a study of the worldwide spread of a pandemic influenza and its
possible containment at a global level taking into account all available
information on air travel. We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic
model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban
areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a
sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and
initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each
spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the
pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared
the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel
restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We show that the
inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence
probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs
in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a
reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use
sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction
with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly
contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the
unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20%
of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of
limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we
demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the
containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that
made part of their resources available for global use.

    <title>The Light Quanta Modulated Physiological Response of Brassica Juncea
  Seedlings Subjected to Ni(II) Stress</title>
    <summary>  This work is a study of the inter-relationship between parameters that
principally affect metal up-take in the plant. The relationships between the
concentration of metal in the growth medium, Cs, the concentration of metal
absorbed by the plant, Cp, and the total biomass achieved, M, all of which are
factors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been
investigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings
to Ni(II) stress. The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)
concentration in the agar gel and the diurnal light quanta (DLQ) as
independently variable parameters. Observations included the evidence of light
enhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the
shoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B.
juncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of
M on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal
accumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall
metabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor
a high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from
the medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven
biomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to
remove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these
observations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation
engineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are
discussed.

    <title>Influence of experimental context on the development of anhedonia in
  male mice imposed to chronic social stress</title>
    <summary>  Anhedonia is one of the key symptoms of depression in humans. Consumption of
1% sucrose solution supplemented with 0.2% vanillin was studied in two
experimental contexts in male mice living under chronic social stress induced
by daily experience of defeats in agonistic interactions and leading to
development of depression. In the first experiment, vanillin sucrose solution
was made available as an option of water during 10 days to mice living in group
home cages. Then the mice were subjected to social defeat stress and during
stress exposure they were provided with both vanillin sucrose solution and
water using a free two bottles choice paradigm. In the other experiment,
vanillin sucrose solution were first offered to mice after 8 days of exposure
to social defeat stress. Males familiar with vanillin sucrose solution showed
vanillin sucrose preference while experiencing defeat stress: consumption of
vanillin sucrose solution was about 70% of total liquid consumption. However,
the consumption of vanillin sucrose solution per gram of body weight in mice
imposed to social stress during 20 days was significantly lower than in control
males. In the second experiment, males after 8 days of social defeat stress
were found to consume significantly less vanillin sucrose solution as compared
with control males. On average during two weeks of measurements, vanillin
sucrose solution intake was less than 20% of total liquid consumption in males
with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consumption per gram of body weight
also appeared to be significantly lower than in control group. Influence of the
experimental context on the development of anhedonia, which was measured by the
reduction in sucrose solution intake by chronically stressed male mice, has
been discussed.

    <title>Imposition of Different Optimizing Object with Non-Linear Constraints on
  Flux Sampling and Elimination of Free Futile Pathways</title>
    <summary>  Constraint-based modeling has been widely used on metabolic networks
analysis, such as biosynthetic prediction and flux optimization. The linear
constraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,
biological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,
recently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known
as "loop law", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be
unfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been
successfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo
sampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced
to optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of
Helicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,
biological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including
reversibility and "loop law". The sampling method has also been employed to
optimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is
unified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a
sample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based
on solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been
proposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow
could be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to
the biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the
sampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the
results have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the
pathways related to Biomass synthesis.

    <title>Leaf litter decomposition -- Estimates of global variability based on
  Yasso07 model</title>
    <summary>  Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It
accounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in
formation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest
terrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks
to climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the
global patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this
process and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar
litter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from
approximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model
called Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the
effects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little
systematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial
litter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.
Illustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example
calculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass
still remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous
litter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a
direct result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied
according to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions
and ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was
adequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences
in litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as
statistically significant.

    <title>Information Maximization Fails to Maximize Expected Utility in a Simple
  Foraging Model</title>
    <summary>  Information theory has explained the organization of many biological
phenomena, from the physiology of sensory receptive fields to the variability
of certain DNA sequence ensembles. Some scholars have proposed that information
should provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that
any behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must
necessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by
providing a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a
particular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a
food source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates
the statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the
creature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision
process. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite
dimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining
that reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of "information
states". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the
performance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other
candidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information
optimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.
The rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not
predict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of
different strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,
in particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there
is no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral
optimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple
tradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the
food itself.

    <title>A Network-Based Meta-Population Approach to Model Rift Valley Fever
  Epidemics</title>
    <summary>  Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been expanding its geographical
distribution with important implications for both human and animal health. The
emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing
presence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and
veterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention
should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a
new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential
equations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter
driven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted
contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions
and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for
each set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among
regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not
only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated
into the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data
from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the
epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive
set of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for
accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the
world. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model
differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different
provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the
outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction
number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction
number are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.

    <title>Anthropogenic Renourishment Feedback on Shorebirds: a Multispecies
  Bayesian Perspective</title>
    <summary>  In this paper the realized niche of the Snowy Plover (Charadrius
alexandrinus), a primarily resident Florida shorebird, is described as a
function of the scenopoetic and bionomic variables at the nest-, landscape-,
and regional-scale. We identified some pos- sible geomorphological controls
that influence nest-site selection and survival using data collected along the
Florida Gulf coast. In particular we focused on the effects of beach
replenishment interventions on the Snowy Plover (SP), and on the migratory
Piping Plover (PP) (Charadrius melodus) and Red Knot (RK) (Calidris canutus).
To quantify the relationship between past renourishment projects and shorebird
species we used a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior
distribution of the binomial probabilities that a region is not a nesting or a
wintering ground conditional on the occurrence of a beach replenishment
intervention in the same and the previous year. The results indicate that it
was 2.3, 3.1, and 0.8 times more likely that a region was not a wintering
ground following a year with a renourishment intervention for the SP, PP and RK
respectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a
breeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy
principle model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP
during the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was
observed ap- peared quite different. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable
habitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas,
and uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to
convert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive
feedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.

    <title>No entailing laws, but enablement in the evolution of the biosphere</title>
    <summary>  Biological evolution is a complex blend of ever changing structural
stability, variability and emergence of new phenotypes, niches, ecosystems. We
wish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view
of law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the
variability of the very "contexts of life": the interactions between organisms,
biological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically
indeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the "niches"
which constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the
mathematical unprestatability of the "phase space" (space of possibilities), no
laws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,
from life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation
and diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a
novel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be
carried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions
of phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as
invariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of
physical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound
biological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of
"enablement". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a
difference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences
will allow us to stress that "non conservation principles" are at the core of
evolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation
principles as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry
changes in physics, will be discussed, and lead to "extended criticality" as a
conceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.

    <title>Individual rules for trail pattern formation in Argentine ants
  (Linepithema humile)</title>
    <summary>  We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an
empty arena. Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated
pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and
at different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to
pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and
changes in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response
to local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by
these concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over
time, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant
determining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a
Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the
two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the
turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the
well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the
results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990).
However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function
led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the
literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that
in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be
derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations
that we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the
preferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.

    <title>The Geometry of Morphogenesis and the Morphogenetic Field Concept</title>
    <summary>  The process of morphogenesis, which can be defined as an evolution of the
form of an organism, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in the life
sciences. It is clear, that gene expression patterns cannot explain the
development of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space.
Here, we suggest a set of postulates and possible approaches for discovering
the correspondence between molecular biological information and its realization
in a given geometry of an organism in space-time. First, we suggest that the
geometry of the organism and its parts is coded by a molecular code located on
the cell surfaces in such a way that, with each cell, there can be associated a
corresponding matrix, containing this code. As a particular model, we propose
coding by several types of oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Second,
we provide a notion of cell event, and suggest a description of development as
a tree of cell events, where under cell event we understand the changing of
cell state, e.g. the processes of cell division, cell growth/death, shift or
differentiation. Next we suggest describing these cell motion laws using the
notion of a "morphogenetic field", meaning by the field an object in an "event
space" over a "cell space", which govern the transformation of the coded
biological information into an instructive signal for a cell event for a given
cell, depending on the position of a cell in the developing embryo. The matrix
on a cell surface will be changed after each cell event according to the
rule(s) dictated by the morphogenetic field of an organism. Finally, we provide
some ideas on the connection between morphogenetic code on a cell surface, cell
motion law(s) and the geometry of an embryo.

    <title>The "Wow! signal" of the terrestrial genetic code</title>
    <summary>  It has been repeatedly proposed to expand the scope for SETI, and one of the
suggested alternatives to radio is the biological media. Genomic DNA is already
used on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity,
but stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible
mapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying
the code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over
cosmological timescales. Thus, it represents a reliable storage for an
intelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic
requirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far
from being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally
cannot be ruled out. A statistically strong signal in the genetic code is then
a testable consequence of such scenario. Here we show that the terrestrial code
displays a thorough precision orderliness matching the criteria to be
considered an informational signal. Simple arrangements of the code reveal an
ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of the same symbolic
language. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a
product of precision logic and nontrivial computing rather than of stochastic
processes. The patterns are profound to the extent that the code mapping itself
is uniquely deduced from their algebraic representation. The signal displays
readily recognizable hallmarks of artificiality. Besides, extraction of the
signal involves logically straightforward but abstract operations, making the
patterns essentially irreducible to any natural origin. Plausible way of
embedding the signal into the code and possible interpretation of its content
are discussed. Overall, while the code is nearly optimized biologically, its
limited capacity is used extremely efficiently to store non-biological
information.

    <title>Demonstrating that chlorine dioxide is a size-selective antimicrobial
  agent and high purity ClO2 can be used as a local antiseptic</title>
    <summary>  Background / Aims ClO2, the so-called "ideal biocide", could also be applied
as an antiseptic if it was understood why the solution's rapid killing of
microbes does not cause any harm to humans or to animals. Our aim was to study
both theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find
the source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through
protein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to
reaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and
estimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the
reaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,
three patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity
ClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of
the reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to
the square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small
ones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a
bacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the
few minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough
to kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living
tissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects. Pictures of
successful wound healings confirm these considerations. Various properties of
ClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly,
bacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with
biological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Conclusion
Selectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different
biochemistry, but on their different size. Preliminary clinical results
encourage further research with this promising local antiseptic.

    <title>An Improved Temporal Formulation of Pupal Transpiration in Glossina</title>
    <summary>  The temporal aspect of a model of pupal dehydration is improved upon. The
observed dependence of pupal transpiration on time is attributed to an
alternation between two, essential modes, for which the deposition of a thin,
pupal skin inside the puparium and its subsequent demise are thought to be
responsible. For each mode of transpiration, the results of the Bursell (1958)
investigation into pupal dehydration are used as a rudimentary data set. These
data are generalised to all temperatures and humidities by invoking the
property of multiplicative separability. The problem, then, is that as the
temperature varies with time, so does the metabolism and the developmental
stages to which the model data pertain, must necessarily warp. The
puparial-duration formula of Phelps and Burrows (1969) and Hargrove (2004) is
exploited to facilitate a mapping between the constant-temperature time domain
of the data and that of some, more general case at hand. The resulting,
Glossina morsitans model is extrapolated to other species using their relative
surface areas, their relative protected and unprotected transpiration rates and
their different fourth instar excretions (drawing, to a lesser extent, from the
data of Buxton and Lewis, 1934). In this way the problem of pupal dehydration
is formulated as a series of integrals and the consequent survival can be
predicted. The discovery of a distinct definition for hygrophilic species,
within the formulation, prompts the investigation of the hypothetical effect of
a two-day heat wave on pupae. This leads to the conclusion that the
classification of species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely
true only in so much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the
hours shortly before eclosion.

    <title>Substance Abuse via Legally Prescribed Drugs: The Case of Vicodin in the
  United States</title>
    <summary>  Vicodin is the most commonly prescribed pain reliever in the United States.
Research indicates that there are two million people who are currently abusing
Vicodin, and the majority of those who abuse Vicodin were initially exposed to
it via prescription. Our goal is to determine the most effective strategies for
reducing the overall population of Vicodin abusers. More specifically, we focus
on whether prevention methods aimed at educating doctors and patients on the
potential for drug abuse or treatment methods implemented after a person abuses
Vicodin will have a greater overall impact. We consider one linear and two
non-linear compartmental models in which medical users of Vicodin can
transition into the abuser compartment or leave the population by no longer
taking the drug. Once Vicodin abusers, people can transition into a treatment
compartment, with the possibility of leaving the population through successful
completion of treatment or of relapsing and re-entering the abusive
compartment. The linear model assumes no social interaction, while both
non-linear models consider interaction. One considers interaction with abusers
affecting the relapse rate, while the other assumes both this and an additional
interaction between the number of abusers and the number of new prescriptions.
Sensitivity analyses are conducted varying the rates of success of these
intervention methods measured by the parameters to determine which strategy has
the greatest impact on controlling the population of Vicodin abusers. From
these models and analyses, we determine that manipulating parameters tied to
prevention measures has a greater impact on reducing the population of abusers
than manipulating parameters associated with treatment. We also note that
increasing the rate at which abusers seek treatment affects the population of
abusers more than the success rate of treatment itself.

    <title>Responding to the AIDS epidemic in Angola</title>
    <summary>  The epidemic of HIV in Angola started later and stabilized at lower levels
than elsewhere in southern Africa. With a relatively small population and a
high GDP, Angola is in a good position to intervene decisively to control HIV.
The effectiveness, availability and affordability of anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) make it possible to contemplate ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in
Angola. We consider what would have happened without ART, the No ART
counterfactual, the impact on the epidemic if the current roll-out of ART is
maintained, the Current Programme, the impact if coverage is rapidly increased
to reach 90% of people with CD4+ cell counts below 350/micro-litre by 2015 and
HIV-positive pregnant women are all offered ART for life (Option B+), the
Accelerated Programme, and what might be possible under the 2013 guidelines
from the World Health Organization, starting in 2015 and reaching full coverage
of ART by 2018, the Expanded Programme.If Angola is to reach the 2015 targets
in the Presidents Acceleration Plan testing services will need to be expanded.
A regular, uninterrupted supply of drugs will have to be assured. Existing
health staff will need to be strengthened. Community health workers will need
to be mobilized and trained to encourage people to be tested and accept
treatment, to monitor progress and to support people on treatment; this in turn
will help to reduce stigma and discrimination, loss to follow up of people
diagnosed with HIV, and improve adherence for those on treatment. Effective
monitoring and evaluation systems will have to be in place and data collection
will have to be extended and improved to support the development of reliable
estimates of the current and future state of the epidemic, the success of the
programme, levels of viral load suppression for those on ART and the incidence
of infection.

    <title>Population pressure and global markets drive a decade of forest cover
  change in Africa's Albertine Rift</title>
    <summary>  The Albertine Rift region faces rapid human population growth, while being a
biodiversity hotspot. Using satellite-derived continuous forest cover change
data, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, and agricultural
production data, and local demographic and geographic variables to assess
multilevel forces driving significant local forest cover loss and gain outside
protected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes
that drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, we
constructed models of change in each direction. Although forest cover change
varied by country, national level population change was the strongest driver of
forest loss rate for all countries, with a population doubling predicted to
cause 2.06 percent annual cover loss, while doubling tea production was
predicted to cause 1.90 percent. The rate of forest cover gain was associated
positively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but
negatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting
production drivers at multiple levels mitigate reforestation. We found a small,
but significant, decrease of forest cover loss rate with increasing distance
from protected areas, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape
change near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate
of forest cover gain, cover loss also correlated to lower local population
density, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale
forces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and
market forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of
change, calling into question the necessary scale of forest protection policy
in this biodiversity hotspot.

    <title>Mass Action and Conservation of Current</title>
    <summary>  The law of mass action is used widely. The law of mass action does not
automatically conserve current, as is clear from mathematics of a simple case,
chosen to illustrate the issues. The law of mass action does not force a series
of chemical reactions to have the same current flow everywhere. Interruption of
far-away current does not stop current everywhere in a series of chemical
reactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and
equation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The
additional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the
chemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that
case, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of
charge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods
that enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved. Variational methods
have only recently been developed to ensure that charge flow is conserved
globally, along with mass, in dissipative systems like ions in solution or
proteins. The Energy Variational Approach EnVarA should allow the development
of more robust models of chemical, biochemical, and biological systems, making
practical devices more easy to design and build. These difficulties arise away
from equilibrium, when current flows, and the law of mass action is applied to
a non-equilibrium situation, different from the systems considered when the law
was originally derived. Non-equilibrium systems are important. Almost all of
biology occurs away from equilibrium. Almost all devices of our technology
function away from equilibrium. I believe robust models and device designs in
the chemical world will not be possible until continuity of current is embedded
in a generalization of the law of mass action using a consistent variational
model of energy and dissipation.

    <title>Chirality in a quaternionic representation of the genetic code</title>
    <summary>  A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the
authors, is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and
amino acids. The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a
prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with
each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer
quaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of
the standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show
the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,
associated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type
quaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order
quaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the
tertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this
context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the
set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of
subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by
putting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D
and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,
respectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we
define functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer
quaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a
given D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that
one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for
the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to
describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.

    <title>X-ray experiment provides a way to reveal the distinction between
  discrete and continuous conformation of myosin head</title>
    <summary>  The corner stone of the classical model after Huxley and Simmons is
supposition that a myosin head can reside only in several discrete states and
irregularly jumps from one state to another. Until now, it has not been found a
way to experimentally verify this supposition although confirmation or
refutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of
myosin motor problem. Here I show that a set of equal myosin heads arranged
equidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with
the type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one
and the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same
form-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the
geometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine
the X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is
the same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete
states, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors
corresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases
of X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every
quantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,
this results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern
should slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with
the continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are
compared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is
insignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of
conformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of
discrete model). Consequently, one can with luck attempt to find out this
difference using a high-sensitive equipment.

    <title>An Introduction to Programming for Bioscientists: A Python-based Primer</title>
    <summary>  Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several
decades, such that virtually all contemporary research in the biosciences
utilizes computer programs. The computational advances have come on many
fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and
algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal
array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics;
genome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies;
structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular
assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of
post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology.
The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most
indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become
a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its
straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first
language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming,
as well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and
third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into
virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses,
phylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic
introduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and
exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text
culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of
Supplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as
that of a 'variable', the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point
of writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between
two DNA sequences.

    <title>Comparative Salt Tolerance Study of Some Acacia Species at Seed
  Germination Stage</title>
    <summary>  Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed
germination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations
in order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant
genotypes. Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses
using 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected
germination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time
(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that
germination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl
concentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance
was observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate
salt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be
more accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,
remains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)
and velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the
high salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt
environment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended
for plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when
ungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,
they recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high
speed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a
reversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion
toxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher
concentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most
tolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be
utilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.

    <title>The Drought-Stress Response of a Drought Resistant Impatiens Processed
  in PEG-6000 Solution in a Simulation Test</title>
    <summary>  Premise of the Study: Impatiens is a commonly seen garden flower, renowned
for its strong adaptability and long history of cultivation. However, seldom
has any research touched on its physiological resistance mechanism. In this
experiment, the impatiens is selected from those which experienced aerospace
mutation and thereafter 12 years of cultivation and breeding. Therefore, it is
superior to the non-mutagenized impatiens in terms of drought resistance and
demonstrates tremendous differences from the normal impatiens in physiology,
which intrigues scholars to search for the underlying reasons . Methods: By
reference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens
seeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure
the germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and
expression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower
reaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct
difference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms
of germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the
relative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene
SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the
mutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can
further cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:
In this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens
improves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained
impatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher
application value in garden virescence.

    <title>The design of a proto-animal brain based upon spike timing</title>
    <summary>  A basal animal model is described as an organism similar to a Limpet that is
attached to the sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model
uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition
logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),
and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift
registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse
train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that
consist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive
the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these
individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the
ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of
getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community.
They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for
each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an
object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of
the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed
in its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add
plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the
animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve
that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow
the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using
permanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,
information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one
logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)
connections between cells.

    <title>Flux ratios and channel structures</title>
    <summary>  We investigate Ussing's unidirectional fluxes and flux ratios of charged
tracers motivated particularly by the insightful proposal of Hodgkin and Keynes
on a relation between flux ratios and channel structure. Our study is based on
analysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic
flows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson
equation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and
is in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all
physical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions
and channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in
flux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk
conditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that
are specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.
Universal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux
ratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two
treatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important
properties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main
ion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests
a better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the
main ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns
ratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties
of channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of
estimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the
spatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and
thus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,
even with ideal ionic solutions. ...

    <title>Interest of Integrating Spaceborne LiDAR Data to Improve the Estimation
  of Biomass in High Biomass Forested Areas</title>
    <summary>  Mapping forest AGB (Above Ground Biomass) is of crucial importance to
estimate the carbon emissions associated with tropical deforestation. This
study proposes a method to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of
existing AGB map (Vieilledent's AGB map) by using a map of correction factors
generated from GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data.
The Vieilledent's AGB map of Madagascar was established using optical images,
with parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, climatic
variables, and field inventories. In the present study, first, GLAS LiDAR data
were used to obtain a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation)
estimation of AGB (GLAS AGB) covering Madagascar forested areas, with a density
of 0.52 footprint/km 2. Second, the difference between the AGB from the
Vieilledent's AGB map and GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location was
calculated, and additional spatially distributed correction factors were
obtained. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed by taking
into account the spatial structure of these additional correction factors to
provide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the
correction factor maps were summed to improve the Vieilledent's AGB map. The
results showed that the integration of GLAS data improves the precision of
Vieilledent's AGB map by approximately 7 t/ha. By integrating GLAS data, the
RMSE on AGB estimates decreases from 81 t/ha (R 2 = 0.62) to 74.1 t/ha (R 2 =
0.71). Most importantly, we showed that this approach using LiDAR data avoids
underestimating high biomass values (new maximum AGB of 650 t/ha compared to
550 t/ha with the first approach).

    <title>Improving institutional memory on challenges and methods for estimation
  of pig herd antimicrobial exposure based on data from the Danish Veterinary
  Medicines Statistics Program (VetStat)</title>
    <summary>  With the increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance, more attention
has been directed towards surveillance of both human and veterinary
antimicrobial use. Since the early 2000s, several research papers on Danish pig
antimicrobial usage have been published, based on data from the Danish
Veterinary Medicines Statistics Program (VetStat). VetStat was established in
2000, as a national database containing detailed information on purchases of
veterinary medicine. This paper presents a critical set of challenges
originating from static system features, which researchers must address when
estimating antimicrobial exposure in Danish pig herds. Most challenges
presented are followed by at least one robust solution. A set of challenges
requiring awareness from the researcher, but for which no immediate solution
was available, were also presented. The selection of challenges and solutions
was based on a consensus by a cross-institutional group of researchers working
in projects using VetStat data. No quantitative data quality evaluations were
performed, as the frequency of errors and inconsistencies in a dataset will
vary, depending on the period covered in the data. Instead, this paper focuses
on clarifying how VetStat data may be translated to an estimation of the
antimicrobial exposure at herd level, by suggesting uniform methods of
extracting and editing data, in order to obtain reliable and comparable
estimates on pig antimicrobial consumption for research purposes.

    <title>SETI in vivo: testing the we-are-them hypothesis</title>
    <summary>  After it was proposed that life on Earth might descend from seeding by an
earlier civilization, some authors noted that this alternative offers a
testable aspect: the seeds could be supplied with a signature that might be
found in extant organisms. In particular, it was suggested that the optimal
location for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part
of cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too
speculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a
signature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is
doomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss
the motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that "biological SETI"
involves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a
well-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms
of molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting
the guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first
principles and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the
canonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked
systematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,
we perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.
Statistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the
code, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison
analysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,
in agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the
canonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found
attributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make
perfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most
universal codes of culture.

    <title>Information Theory and the Length Distribution of all Discrete Systems</title>
    <summary>  We begin with the extraordinary observation that the length distribution of
80 million proteins in UniProt, the Universal Protein Resource, measured in
amino acids, is qualitatively identical to the length distribution of large
collections of computer functions measured in programming language tokens, at
all scales. That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural
properties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might
share the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.
  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components
built from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the
Conservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical
mechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous
and homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique
alphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp
unimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain
components each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and
yield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.
  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer
software, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the
elements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour
co-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts). In
each case, the predictions of the theory are tested and supported to high
levels of statistical significance. We also show that in the same heterogeneous
system, different but consistent alphabets must be related by a power-law. We
demonstrate this on a large body of music by excluding and including note
duration in the definition of the unique alphabet of notes.

    <title>An Algorithmic Information Calculus for Causal Discovery and
  Reprogramming Systems</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to steer,
manipulate, reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of dynamical
systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contribution of
each of the system's by exploiting first principles from the theory of
computability and algorithmic information. This calculus consists in finding
and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its
algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative
shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The
approach is an alternative to statistical approaches to infer causal
relationships and to provide theoretical expectations from perturbation
analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system's runs
in parallel to its dynamic landscape providing a path to move systems on one
plane to have controlled effects on the other plane. Based on these methods, we
advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or
access to the system's actual kinetic equations or to probability
distributions. This new dimension provides a suite of powerful parameter-free
algorithms of wide applicability ranging from causal discovery, dimension
reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal
algorithmic-randomness principle and a system's (re)programmability index. We
apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to
evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating na\"ive to Th17 cell, and
the CellNet database). We show the capabilities to pinpoint key elements
(genes) related to cell function and cell development conforming with the
biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature
demonstrating how the method can reshape a system's dynamics in a controlled
manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.

    <title>Quantum origin of life: methodological, epistemological and ontological
  issues</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this essay is to analyze the role of quantum mechanics as an
inherent characteristic of life. During the last ten years the problem of the
origin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many
authors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the
problem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second
presents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded
on the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in
the third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum
origin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two
of which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and
biosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and
experimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main
research themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a
physicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life
while the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the
essence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the
Information Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life
through replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is
fundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum
computation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto
replicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence
of quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve
the question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put
forward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in
the origin of genetic language.

    <title>Scaling and Intermittency in Animal Behavior</title>
    <summary>  Scale-invariant spatial or temporal patterns and L\'evy flight motion have
been observed in a large variety of biological systems. It has been argued that
animals in general might perform L\'evy flight motion with power law
distribution of times between two changes of the direction of motion. Here we
study the temporal behaviour of nesting gilts. The time spent by a gilt in a
given form of activity has power law probability distribution without finite
average. Further analysis reveals intermittent eruption of certain periodic
behavioural sequences which are responsible for the scaling behaviour and
indicates the existence of a critical state. We show that this behaviour is in
close analogy with temporal sequences of velocity found in turbulent flows,
where random and regular sequences alternate and form an intermittent sequence.

    <title>Phase Disorder Effects in a Cellular Automaton Model of Epidemic
  Propagation</title>
    <summary>  A deterministic cellular automaton rule defined on the Moore neighbourhood is
studied as a model of epidemic propagation. The directed nature of the
interaction between cells allows one to introduce the dependence on a disorder
parameter that determines the fraction of ``in-phase'' cells. Phase-disorder is
shown to produce peculiar changes in the dynamical and statistical properties
of the different evolution regimes obtained by varying the infection and the
immunization periods. In particular, the finite-velocity spreading of
perturbations, characterizing chaotic evolution, can be prevented by
localization effects induced by phase-disorder, that may also yield spatial
isotropy of the infection propagation as a statistical effect. Analogously, the
structure of phase-synchronous ordered patterns is rapidly lost as soon as
phase-disorder is increased, yielding a defect-mediated turbulent regime.

    <title>Electrostatic correlations: from Plasma to Biology</title>
    <summary>  Electrostatic correlations play an important role in physics, chemistry and
biology. In plasmas they lead to thermodynamic instability similar to the
liquid-gas phase transition of simple molecular fluids. For charged colloidal
suspensions the electrostatic correlations are responsible for screening and
colloidal charge renormalization. In aqueous solutions containing multivalent
counterions they can lead to charge inversion and flocculation. In biological
systems the correlations account for the organization of cytoskeleton and the
compaction of genetic material. In spite of their ubiquity, the true importance
of electrostatic correlations has become fully appreciated only quite recently.
In this paper, I will review the thermodynamic consequences of electrostatic
correlations in a variety of systems ranging from classical plasmas to
molecular biology.

    <title>Viral self-assembly as a thermodynamic process</title>
    <summary>  The protein shells, or capsids, of all sphere-like viruses adopt icosahedral
symmetry. In the present paper we propose a statistical thermodynamic model for
viral self-assembly. We find that icosahedral symmetry is not expected for
viral capsids constructed from structurally identical protein subunits and that
this symmetry requires (at least) two internal "switching" configurations of
the protein. Our results indicate that icosahedral symmetry is not a generic
consequence of free energy minimization but requires optimization of internal
structural parameters of the capsid proteins.

    <title>Universality in the merging dynamics of parametric active contours: a
  study in MRI-based lung segmentation</title>
    <summary>  Measurement of lung ventilation is one of the most reliable techniques of
diagnosing pulmonary diseases. The time consuming and bias prone traditional
methods using hyperpolarized H${}^{3}$He and ${}^{1}$H magnetic resonance
imageries have recently been improved by an automated technique based on
multiple active contour evolution. Mapping results from an equivalent
thermodynamic model, here we analyse the fundamental dynamics orchestrating the
active contour (AC) method. We show that the numerical method is inherently
connected to the universal scaling behavior of a classical nucleation-like
dynamics. The favorable comparison of the exponent values with the theoretical
model render further credentials to our claim.

    <title>Epidemic Incidence in Correlated Complex Networks</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a numerical method to solve epidemic models on the underlying
topology of complex networks. The approach exploits the mean-field like rate
equations describing the system and allows to work with very large system
sizes, where Monte Carlo simulations are useless due to memory needs. We then
study the SIR epidemiological model on assortative networks, providing
numerical evidence of the absence of epidemic thresholds. Besides, the time
profiles of the populations are analyzed. Finally, we stress that the present
method would allow to solve arbitrary epidemic-like models provided that they
can be described by mean-field rate equations.

    <title>Pore dynamics of osmotically stressed vesicles</title>
    <summary>  We present a theory for pore dynamics of osmotically stressed vesicles. When
a liposome with an internal concentration of solute is placed inside a
solute-depleted medium, an osmotic flow of solvent through the lipid bilayer
leads to swelling of vesicle and to increase in membrane surface tension. This
can result in membrane rupture and opening of thermal pores. Depending on the
internal concentration of solute and the size of the vesicle, pores can close
rapidly or be long-lived. We find that the life span of the long-lived pores
scales non-trivially with the size of the liposome. Closure of the long-lived
pore is followed by a rapid flicker-like opening and closing of short-lived
pores. Our model is consistent with the observation of long-lived pores in red
blood cell ghosts.

    <title>Dictionary based methods for information extraction</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we present a general method for information extraction that
exploits the features of data compression techniques. We first define and focus
our attention on the so-called "dictionary" of a sequence. Dictionaries are
intrinsically interesting and a study of their features can be of great
usefulness to investigate the properties of the sequences they have been
extracted from (e.g. DNA strings). We then describe a procedure of string
comparison between dictionary-created sequences (or "artificial texts") that
gives very good results in several contexts. We finally present some results on
self-consistent classification problems.

    <title>Core percolation and onset of complexity in Boolean networks</title>
    <summary>  The determination and classification of fixed points of large Boolean
networks is addressed in terms of constraint satisfaction problem. We develop a
general simplification scheme that, removing all those variables and functions
belonging to trivial logical cascades, returns the computational core of the
network. The onset of an easy-to-complex regulatory phase is introduced as a
function of the parameters of the model, identifying both theoretically and
algorithmically the relevant regulatory variables.

    <title>Active transport: A kinetic description based on thermodynamic grounds</title>
    <summary>  We show that active transport processes in biological systems can be
understood through a local equilibrium description formulated at the mesoscale,
the scale to describe stochastic processes. This new approach uses the method
established by nonequilibrium thermodynamics to account for the irreversible
processes occurring at this scale and provides nonlinear kinetic equations for
the rates in terms of the driving forces. The results show that the application
domain of nonequilibrium thermodynamics method to biological systems goes
beyond the linear domain. A model for transport of Ca$^{2+}$ by the
Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, coupled to the hydrolysis of adenosine-triphosphate is
analyzed in detail showing that it depends on the reaction Gibbs energy in a
non-linear way. Our results unify thermodynamic and kinetic descriptions,
thereby opening new perspectives in the study of different transport phenomena
in biological systems.

    <title>Complex networks generated by the Penna bit-string model: Emergence of
  small-world and assortative mixing</title>
    <summary>  The Penna bit-string model successfully encompasses many phenomena of
population evolution, including inheritance, mutation, evolution and ageing. If
we consider social interactions among individuals in the Penna model, the
population will form a complex network. In this paper, we first modify the
Verhulst factor to control only the birth rate, and introduce activity-based
preferential reproduction of offspring in the Penna model. The social
interactions among individuals are generated by both inheritance and
activity-based preferential increase. Then we study the properties of the
complex network generated by the modified Penna model. We find that the
resulting complex network has a small-world effect and the assortative mixing
property.

    <title>Epidemic variability in complex networks</title>
    <summary>  We study numerically the variability of the outbreak of diseases on complex
networks. We use a SI model to simulate the disease spreading at short times,
in homogeneous and in scale-free networks. In both cases, we study the effect
of initial conditions on the epidemic's dynamics and its variability. The
results display a time regime during which the prevalence exhibits a large
sensitivity to noise. We also investigate the dependence of the infection time
on nodes' degree and distance to the seed. In particular, we show that the
infection time of hubs have large fluctuations which limit their reliability as
early-detection stations. Finally, we discuss the effect of the multiplicity of
shortest paths between two nodes on the infection time. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the existence of even longer paths reduces the average
infection time. These different results could be of use for the design of
time-dependent containment strategies.

    <title>Reaction-diffusion processes and metapopulation models in heterogeneous
  networks</title>
    <summary>  Dynamical reaction-diffusion processes and meta-population models are
standard modeling approaches for a wide variety of phenomena in which local
quantities - such as density, potential and particles - diffuse and interact
according to the physical laws. Here, we study the behavior of two basic
reaction-diffusion processes ($B \to A$ and $A+B \to 2B$) defined on networks
with heterogeneous topology and no limit on the nodes' occupation number. We
investigate the effect of network topology on the basic properties of the
system's phase diagram and find that the network heterogeneity sustains the
reaction activity even in the limit of a vanishing density of particles,
eventually suppressing the critical point in density driven phase transitions,
whereas phase transition and critical points, independent of the particle
density, are not altered by topological fluctuations. This work lays out a
theoretical and computational microscopic framework for the study of a wide
range of realistic meta-populations models and agent-based models that include
the complex features of real world networks.

    <title>On the Ancestral Compatibility of Two Phylogenetic Trees with Nested
  Taxa</title>
    <summary>  Compatibility of phylogenetic trees is the most important concept underlying
widely-used methods for assessing the agreement of different phylogenetic trees
with overlapping taxa and combining them into common supertrees to reveal the
tree of life. The notion of ancestral compatibility of phylogenetic trees with
nested taxa was introduced by Semple et al in 2004. In this paper we analyze in
detail the meaning of this compatibility from the points of view of the local
structure of the trees, of the existence of embeddings into a common supertree,
and of the joint properties of their cluster representations. Our analysis
leads to a very simple polynomial-time algorithm for testing this
compatibility, which we have implemented and is freely available for download
from the BioPerl collection of Perl modules for computational biology.

    <title>Catastrophe Management and Inter-Reserve Distance for Marine Reserve
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  We consider the optimal spacing between marine reserves for maximising the
viability of a species occupying a reserve network. The closer the networks are
placed together, the higher the probability of colonisation of an empty reserve
by an occupied reserve, thus increasing population viability. However, the
closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability that a
catastrophe will cause extinction of the species in both reserves, thus
decreasing population viability. Using a simple discrete-time Markov chain
model for the presence or absence of the species in each reserve we determine
the distance between the two reserves which provides the optimal trade-off
between these processes, resulting in maximum viability of the species.

    <title>Global Stabilization of a Class of Partially Known Positive Systems</title>
    <summary>  In this report we deal with the problem of global output feedback
stabilization of a class of $n$-dimensional nonlinear positive systems
possessing a one-dimensional unknown, though measured, part. We first propose
our main result, an output feedback control procedure, taking advantage of
measurements of the uncertain part, able to globally stabilize the system
towards an adjustable equilibrium point in the interior of the positive
orthant. Though quite general, this result is based on hypotheses that might be
difficult to check in practice. Then in a second step, through a Theorem on a
class of positive systems linking the existence of a strongly positive
equillibrium to its global asymptotic stability, we propose other hypotheses
for our main result to hold. These new hypotheses are more restrictive but much
simpler to check. Some illustrative examples, highlighting both the potential
complex open loop dynamics (multi-stability, limit cycle, chaos) of the
considered systems and the interest of the control procedure, conclude this
report.

    <title>Mathematical Models of Bipolar Disorder</title>
    <summary>  We use limit cycle oscillators to model Bipolar II disorder, which is
characterized by alternating hypomanic and depressive episodes and afflicts
about one percent of the United States adult population. We consider two
nonlinear oscillator models of a single bipolar patient. In both frameworks, we
begin with an untreated individual and examine the mathematical effects and
resulting biological consequences of treatment. We also briefly consider the
dynamics of interacting bipolar II individuals using weakly-coupled,
weakly-damped harmonic oscillators. We discuss how the proposed models can be
used as a framework for refined models that incorporate additional biological
data. We conclude with a discussion of possible generalizations of our work, as
there are several biologically-motivated extensions that can be readily
incorporated into the series of models presented here.

    <title>Updating Schemes in Random Boolean Networks: Do They Really Matter?</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we try to end the debate concerning the suitability of
different updating schemes in random Boolean networks (RBNs). We quantify for
the first time loose attractors in asyncrhonous RBNs, which allows us to
analyze the complexity reduction related to different updating schemes. We also
report that all updating schemes yield very similar critical stability values,
meaning that the "edge of chaos" does not depend much on the updating scheme.
After discussion, we conclude that synchonous RBNs are justifiable theoretical
models of biological networks.

    <title>Modeling Endogenous Social Networks: the Example of Emergence and
  Stability of Cooperation without Refusal</title>
    <summary>  Aggregated phenomena in social sciences and economics are highly dependent on
the way individuals interact. To help understanding the interplay between
socio-economic activities and underlying social networks, this paper studies a
sequential prisoner's dilemma with binary choice. It proposes an analytical and
computational insight about the role of endogenous networks in emergence and
sustainability of cooperation and exhibits an alternative to the choice and
refusal mechanism that is often proposed to explain cooperation. The study
focuses on heterogeneous equilibriums and emergence of cooperation from an
all-defector state that are the two stylized facts that this model successfully
reconstructs.

    <title>Universality in Complex Networks: Random Matrix Analysis</title>
    <summary>  We apply random matrix theory to complex networks. We show that nearest
neighbor spacing distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of
various model networks, namely scale-free, small-world and random networks
follow universal Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics of random matrix
theory. Secondly we show an analogy between the onset of small-world behavior,
quantified by the structural properties of networks, and the transition from
Poisson to Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics, quantified by Brody
parameter characterizing a spectral property. We also present our analysis for
a protein-protein interaction network in budding yeast.

    <title>Re-examination of the "3/4-law" of Metabolism</title>
    <summary>  We examine the scaling law $B \propto M^{\alpha}$ which connects organismal
metabolic rate $B$ with organismal mass $M$, where $\alpha$ is commonly held to
be 3/4. Since simple dimensional analysis suggests $\alpha=2/3$, we consider
this to be a null hypothesis testable by empirical studies. We re-analyze data
sets for mammals and birds compiled by Heusner, Bennett and Harvey, Bartels,
Hemmingsen, Brody, and Kleiber, and find little evidence for rejecting
$\alpha=2/3$ in favor of $\alpha=3/4$. For mammals, we find a possible
breakdown in scaling for larger masses reflected in a systematic increase in
$\alpha$. We also review theoretical justifications of $\alpha=3/4$ based on
dimensional analysis, nutrient-supply networks, and four-dimensional biology.
We find that present theories for $\alpha=3/4$ require assumptions that render
them unconvincing for rejecting the null hypothesis that $\alpha=2/3$.

    <title>Kinetic model of DNA replication in eukaryotic organisms</title>
    <summary>  We formulate a kinetic model of DNA replication that quantitatively describes
recent results on DNA replication in the in vitro system of Xenopus laevis
prior to the mid-blastula transition. The model describes well a large amount
of different data within a simple theoretical framework. This allows one, for
the first time, to determine the parameters governing the DNA replication
program in a eukaryote on a genome-wide basis. In particular, we have
determined the frequency of origin activation in time and space during the cell
cycle. Although we focus on a specific stage of development, this model can
easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms, including
budding yeast.

    <title>Modeling oscillatory Microtubule--Polymerization</title>
    <summary>  Polymerization of microtubules is ubiquitous in biological cells and under
certain conditions it becomes oscillatory in time. Here simple reaction models
are analyzed that capture such oscillations as well as the length distribution
of microtubules. We assume reaction conditions that are stationary over many
oscillation periods, and it is a Hopf bifurcation that leads to a persistent
oscillatory microtubule polymerization in these models. Analytical expressions
are derived for the threshold of the bifurcation and the oscillation frequency
in terms of reaction rates as well as typical trends of their parameter
dependence are presented. Both, a catastrophe rate that depends on the density
of {\it guanosine triphosphate} (GTP) liganded tubulin dimers and a delay
reaction, such as the depolymerization of shrinking microtubules or the decay
of oligomers, support oscillations. For a tubulin dimer concentration below the
threshold oscillatory microtubule polymerization occurs transiently on the
route to a stationary state, as shown by numerical solutions of the model
equations. Close to threshold a so--called amplitude equation is derived and it
is shown that the bifurcation to microtubule oscillations is supercritical.

    <title>On physical nature of radiation regulating quantity of cells in
  population</title>
    <summary>  It is shown, that spontaneous ultraviolet radiation of cells (infusoria)
plays the role of agent, restricting the upper limit of the quantity of cells
in quasi-stationary phase of cultire's development. The spectral region of this
radiation defined experimentally occurred to be in the range of 200-290 nm. As
the filter cutting off the short wave length part of the spectrum (below 290nm)
1 mm thick plexiglas has been used, while as the filters transmitting short
wave part of the spectrum - 5 mkm thick fluorostatic film or 1 mm thick optical
quartz has been selected. It has been shown, that dynamics of development of
the cells in the culture depends on transparency of nutrient medium to
spontaneous ultraviolet radiation of the cells. Conclusion has been made, that
superweak chemiluminescence of the cells is not a worthless metabolism product,
but plays significant biological role.

    <title>Role of Polymer Loops in DNA Replication</title>
    <summary>  Loop formation in long molecules occurs many places in nature, from solutions
of carbon nanotubes to polymers inside a cell. In this article, we review
theoretical studies of the static and dynamic properties of polymer loops. For
example, long polymers must search many configurations to find a "target"
binding site, while short polymers are stiff and resist bending. In between,
there is an optimal loop size, which balances the entropy of long loops against
the energetic cost of short loops. We show that such simple pictures of loop
formation can explain several long-standing observations in DNA replication,
quantitatively.

    <title>Spatiotemporal Pattern Formation in BioFluids I: Cell Shape Perturbants
  As Evidence of Spatially-Organised Membrane Flows</title>
    <summary>  I show the assumed Bilayer structure of cell membranes is Topologically
falsified by known aminophospholipid dynamics in metabolically-active, Far from
Equilibrium cells. The sensitivity of lipid and cytoplasmic flows to
temperature, surfactants, viscosity and the gravity vector are used to suggest
that rather than being random viscous fluids as currently assumed, both are
actually spatially-organised by convective and shear driven mechanisms in vivo.
I show how protein-lipid feedback provokes a Gestalt Shift in Cell Mechanics by
demonstrating that the primary forces involved in shape changes are generated
by bifurcations in fluid flow Topology, which induce affine deformations of the
cytoskeletal lattice. The feedback model allows the transduction of
Gravitational information into biological form, is universally applicable, and
provides a rationale for Homeoviscous Adaptation, and the extensive lipid
polymorphism observed in Nature.

    <title>Folding Trp-cage to NMR resolution native structure using a
  coarse-grained model</title>
    <summary>  We develop a coarse-grained protein model with a simplified amino acid
interaction potential. We perform discrete molecular dynamics folding
simulations of a small 20 residue protein - Trp-cage - from a fully extended
conformation. We demonstrate the ability of the Trp-cage model to consistently
reach conformations within 2angstrom backbone root-mean-square distance (RMSD)
from the corresponding NMR structures. The minimum RMSD of Trp-cage
conformations in the simulation can be smaller than 1.00angstrom. Our findings
suggest that, at least for the case of Trp-cage, a detailed all-atom protein
model with a physical molecular mechanics force field is not necessary to reach
the native state of a protein. Our results also suggest that the success
folding Trp-cage in our simulations and in the reported all-atom molecular
mechanics simulations studies may be mainly due to the special stabilizing
features specific to this miniprotein.

    <title>SIR dynamics in structured populations with heterogeneous connectivity</title>
    <summary>  Most epidemic models assume equal mixing among members of a population. An
alternative approach is to model a population as random network in which
individuals may have heterogeneous connectivity. This paper builds on previous
research by describing the exact dynamical behavior of epidemics as they occur
in random networks. A system of nonlinear differential equations is presented
which describes the behavior of epidemics spreading through random networks
with arbitrary degree distributions. The degree distribution is observed to
have significant impact on both the final size and time scale of epidemics.

    <title>Abrupt structural transitions involving functionally optimal networks</title>
    <summary>  We show analytically that abrupt structural transitions can arise in
functionally optimal networks, driven by small changes in the level of
transport congestion. Our findings are based on an exactly solvable model
system which mimics a variety of biological and social networks. Our results
offer an explanation as to why such diverse sets of network structures arise in
Nature (e.g. fungi) under essentially the same environmental conditions. As a
by-product of this work, we introduce a novel renormalization scheme involving
`cost motifs' which describes analytically the average shortest path across
multiple-ring-and-hub networks.

    <title>From the Termite Mound to the Stars: Meditations on Discussions With
  Ilya Prigogine</title>
    <summary>  This paper summarizes and re-evaluates Prigogine's evolution of thought, from
a more classical view of thermodynamics with negative implications for the
evolution and persistence of life, through to a far more general and open
formulation of thermodynamics, which does not require assumption of a Big Bang.
The paper also proposes an encoding scheme for the statistics of Lorentzian
systems into mixed Fermi-Bose density matrices, to complete the program given
in quant-ph/0309087, which forcibly points towards symmetry in time at the
microscopic level. The paper suggests future directions to reconcile
microscopic time symmetry and macroscopic asymmetry and evolution, and
concludes that the space-time continuum may be larger and more interesting than
we are able yet to pin down.

    <title>Projective geometry for human motion, with an application to injury risk</title>
    <summary>  We give an exposition of Plucker vectors for a system of joint axes in
projective 3-space. We use Plucker vectors to analyse dependencies among joint
axes, and in particular show that two rotational joints rigidly joined by a bar
and each with 3 degrees of freedom always forms a 5-dimensional system. We
introduce the concept of reduced redundancy in a dependent set of projective
Lines, and argue that reduced redundancy in the axes of a body position
increases injury risk. We apply this to a simple two-joint model of bowling in
cricket, and show by analysis of some experimental data that reduced redundancy
around ball release is observed in some cases.

    <title>The effect of biodiversity on the Hantavirus epizootic</title>
    <summary>  We analyze a mathematical model of the epizootic of Hantavirus in mice
population, including the effect of species which compete with the host. We
show that the existence of the second species has an important consequence for
the prevalence of the infectious agent in the host. When the two mice species
survive in the ecosystem, the competitive pressure of the second species may
lead to reduction or complete elimination of the prevalence of infection. The
transition between the disappearance of the infection and its presence occurs
at a critical value of the competitor's population, resembling a second order
phase transition in a statistical system. The results provide a rigorous
framework for the study of the impact of biodiversity in the propagation of
infectious diseases, and further lends itself to future experimental
verification.

    <title>Human and computer learning: An experimental study</title>
    <summary>  Simple memorizing tasks have been chosen such as a binary code on a matrix.
After the establishment of an appropriate protocol, the codified matrices were
individually presented to 150 university students who had to memorize them. A
computer simulation for a similar task is available which uses a perceptron on
which an algorithm was implemented allowing for some degree of globality
(technically referred to as entropic nonextensivity within a current
generalization of the usual, Boltzmann-Gibbs, statistical mechanics). Our main
observation is that, for the very specific learning task on which we focus
here, humans perform similarly to slightly nonextensive perceptrons.

    <title>Noise Characteristics of Feed Forward Loops</title>
    <summary>  A prominent feature of gene transcription regulatory networks is the presence
in large numbers of motifs, i.e, patterns of interconnection, in the networks.
One such motif is the feed forward loop (FFL) consisting of three genes X, Y
and Z. The protein product of x of X controls the synthesis of protein product
y of Y. Proteins x and y jointly regulate the synthesis of z proteins from the
gene Z. The FFLs, depending on the nature of the regulating interactions, can
be of eight different types which can again be classified into two categories:
coherent and incoherent. In this paper, we study the noise characteristics of
FFLs using the Langevin formalism and the Monte Carlo simulation technique
based on the Gillespie algorithm. We calculate the variances around the mean
protein levels in the steady states of the FFLs and find that, in the case of
coherent FFLs, the most abundant FFL, namely, the Type-1 coherent FFL, is the
least noisy. This is however not so in the case of incoherent FFLs. The results
suggest possible relationships between noise, functionality and abundance.

    <title>Power-law scaling in dimension-to-biomass relationship of fish schools</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the finding that there is some biological universality in the
relationship between school geometry and school biomass of various pelagic
fishes in various conditions, I here establish a scaling law for school
dimensions: the school diameter increases as a power-law function of school
biomass. The power-law exponent is extracted through the data collapse, and is
close to 3/5. This value of the exponent implies that the mean packing density
decreases as the school biomass increases, and the packing structure displays a
mass-fractal dimension of 5/3. By exploiting an analogy between school geometry
and polymer chain statistics, I examine the behavioral algorithm governing the
swollen conformation of large-sized schools of pelagics, and I explain the
value of the exponent.

    <title>The Effects of EGF-Receptor Density on Multiscale Tumor Growth Patterns</title>
    <summary>  We studied the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) density on
tumor growth dynamics, both on the sub- and the multi-cellular level using our
previously developed model. This algorithm simulates the growth of a brain
tumor using a multi-scale two-dimensional agent-based approach with an
integrated transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) induced
EGFR-gene-protein interaction network. The results confirm that increasing cell
receptor density correlates with an acceleration of the tumor system's
spatio-temporal expansion dynamics. This multicellular behavior cannot be
explained solely on the basis of spatial sub-cellular dynamics, which remain
qualitatively similar amongst the three glioma cell lines investigated here in
silico. Rather, we find that cells with higher EGFR density show an early
increase in the phenotypic switching activity between proliferative and
migratory traits, linked to a higher level of initial auto-stimulation by the
PLCgamma-mediated TGFalpha-EGFR autocrine network. This indicates a more active
protein level interaction in these chemotactically acting tumor systems and
supports the role of post-translational regulation for the implemented EGFR
pathway. Implications of these results for experimental cancer research are
discussed.

    <title>Dissociation in a polymerization model of homochirality</title>
    <summary>  A fully self-contained model of homochirality is presented that contains the
effects of both polymerization and dissociation. The dissociation fragments are
assumed to replenish the substrate from which new monomers can grow and undergo
new polymerization. The mean length of isotactic polymers is found to grow
slowly with the normalized total number of corresponding building blocks.
Alternatively, if one assumes that the dissociation fragments themselves can
polymerize further, then this corresponds to a strong source of short polymers,
and an unrealistically short average length of only 3. By contrast, without
dissociation, isotactic polymers becomes infinitely long.

    <title>On the role of chemical synapses in coupled neurons with noise</title>
    <summary>  We examine the behavior in the presence of noise of an array of Morris-Lecar
neurons coupled via chemical synapses. Special attention is devoted to
comparing this behavior with the better known case of electrical coupling
arising via gap junctions. In particular, our numerical simulations show that
chemical synapses are more efficient than gap junctions in enhancing coherence
at an optimal noise (what is known as array-enhanced coherence resonance): in
the case of (nonlinear) chemical coupling, we observe a substantial increase in
the stochastic coherence of the system, in comparison with (linear) electrical
coupling. We interpret this qualitative difference between both types of
coupling as arising from the fact that chemical synapses only act while the
presynaptic neuron is spiking, whereas gap junctions connect the voltage of the
two neurons at all times. This leads in the electrical coupling case to larger
correlations during interspike time intervals which are detrimental to the
array-enhanced coherence effect. Finally, we report on the existence of a
system-size coherence resonance in this locally coupled system, exhibited by
the average membrane potential of the array.
