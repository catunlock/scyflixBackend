    <title>Bounds On Treatment Effects On Transitions</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers the identification of treatment effects on conditional
transition probabilities. We show that even under random assignment only the
instantaneous average treatment effect is point identified. Since treated and
control units drop out at different rates, randomization only ensures the
comparability of treatment and controls at the time of randomization, so that
long-run average treatment effects are not point identified. Instead we derive
informative bounds on these average treatment effects. Our bounds do not impose
(semi)parametric restrictions, for example, proportional hazards. We also
explore various assumptions such as monotone treatment response, common shocks
and positively correlated outcomes that tighten the bounds.

    <title>Quasi-random Monte Carlo application in CGE systematic sensitivity
  analysis</title>
    <summary>  The uncertainty and robustness of Computable General Equilibrium models can
be assessed by conducting a Systematic Sensitivity Analysis. Different methods
have been used in the literature for SSA of CGE models such as Gaussian
Quadrature and Monte Carlo methods. This paper explores the use of Quasi-random
Monte Carlo methods based on the Halton and Sobol' sequences as means to
improve the efficiency over regular Monte Carlo SSA, thus reducing the
computational requirements of the SSA. The findings suggest that by using
low-discrepancy sequences, the number of simulations required by the regular MC
SSA methods can be notably reduced, hence lowering the computational time
required for SSA of CGE models.

    <title>Estimation of Peer Effects in Endogenous Social Networks: Control
  Function Approach</title>
    <summary>  We propose a method of estimating the linear-in-means model of peer effects
in which the peer group, defined by a social network, is endogenous in the
outcome equation for peer effects. Endogeneity is due to unobservable
individual characteristics that influence both link formation in the network
and the outcome of interest. We propose two estimators of the peer effect
equation that control for the endogeneity of the social connections using a
control function approach. We leave the functional form of the control function
unspecified and treat it as unknown. To estimate the model, we use a sieve
semiparametric approach, and we establish asymptotics of the semiparametric
estimator.

    <title>Heterogeneous Employment Effects of Job Search Programmes: A Machine
  Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  We systematically investigate the effect heterogeneity of job search
programmes for unemployed workers. To investigate possibly heterogeneous
employment effects, we combine non-experimental causal empirical models with
Lasso-type estimators. The empirical analyses are based on rich administrative
data from Swiss social security records. We find considerable heterogeneities
only during the first six months after the start of training. Consistent with
previous results of the literature, unemployed persons with fewer employment
opportunities profit more from participating in these programmes. Furthermore,
we also document heterogeneous employment effects by residence status. Finally,
we show the potential of easy-to-implement programme participation rules for
improving average employment effects of these active labour market programmes.

    <title>A Note on the Multi-Agent Contracts in Continuous Time</title>
    <summary>  Dynamic contracts with multiple agents is a classical decentralized
decision-making problem with asymmetric information. In this paper, we extend
the single-agent dynamic incentive contract model in continuous-time to a
multi-agent scheme in finite horizon and allow the terminal reward to be
dependent on the history of actions and incentives. We first derive a set of
sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal contracts in the most
general setting and conditions under which they form a Nash equilibrium. Then
we show that the principal's problem can be converted to solving
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation requiring a static Nash equilibrium.
Finally, we provide a framework to solve this problem by solving partial
differential equations (PDE) derived from backward stochastic differential
equations (BSDE).

    <title>Fixed Effect Estimation of Large T Panel Data Models</title>
    <summary>  This article reviews recent advances in fixed effect estimation of panel data
models for long panels, where the number of time periods is relatively large.
We focus on semiparametric models with unobserved individual and time effects,
where the distribution of the outcome variable conditional on covariates and
unobserved effects is specified parametrically, while the distribution of the
unobserved effects is left unrestricted. Compared to existing reviews on long
panels (Arellano and Hahn 2007; a section in Arellano and Bonhomme 2011) we
discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel Jackknife
bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and
other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias
caused by the estimation of many fixed effects is our main focus, and the
unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula
p/n for all models discussed, with p the number of estimated parameters and n
the total sample size.

    <title>Inference on Estimators defined by Mathematical Programming</title>
    <summary>  We propose an inference procedure for estimators defined by mathematical
programming problems, focusing on the important special cases of linear
programming (LP) and quadratic programming (QP). In these settings, the
coefficients in both the objective function and the constraints of the
mathematical programming problem may be estimated from data and hence involve
sampling error. Our inference approach exploits the characterization of the
solutions to these programming problems by complementarity conditions; by doing
so, we can transform the problem of doing inference on the solution of a
constrained optimization problem (a non-standard inference problem) into one
involving inference based on a set of inequalities with pre-estimated
coefficients, which is much better understood. We evaluate the performance of
our procedure in several Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application
to the classic portfolio selection problem in finance.

    <title>Discrete Choice and Rational Inattention: a General Equivalence Result</title>
    <summary>  This paper establishes a general equivalence between discrete choice and
rational inattention models. Matejka and McKay (2015, AER) showed that when
information costs are modelled using the Shannon entropy function, the
resulting choice probabilities in the rational inattention model take the
multinomial logit form. By exploiting convex-analytic properties of the
discrete choice model, we show that when information costs are modelled using a
class of generalized entropy functions, the choice probabilities in any
rational inattention model are observationally equivalent to some additive
random utility discrete choice model and vice versa. Thus any additive random
utility model can be given an interpretation in terms of boundedly rational
behavior. This includes empirically relevant specifications such as the probit
and nested logit models.

    <title>Sharp bounds for the Roy model</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the empirical content of the Roy model, stripped down to its
essential features, namely sector specific unobserved heterogeneity and
self-selection on the basis of potential outcomes. We characterize sharp bounds
on the joint distribution of potential outcomes and the identifying power of
exclusion restrictions. The latter include variables that affect market
conditions only in one sector and variables that affect sector selection only.
Special emphasis is put on the case of binary outcomes, which has received
little attention in the literature to date. For richer sets of outcomes, we
emphasize the distinction between pointwise sharp bounds and functional sharp
bounds, and its importance, when constructing sharp bounds on functional
features, such as inequality measures. We analyze a Roy model of college major
choice in Canada within this framework, and we take a new look at the
under-representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering or
Mathematics (STEM).

    <title>Differential Pricing of Traffic in the Internet</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing net neutrality debate has generated a lot of heated discussions
on whether or not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and
access providers. Among the several topics discussed, `differential pricing'
has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some
service providers. In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) can exempt data traffic charges for accessing content from
certain CPs or applications (zero-rated) and apply regular charges for
accessing content from other CPs. This allows the possibility for Content
Providers (CPs) to make `sponsorship' agreements to zero-rate their content and
attract more user traffic. In this paper, we study the effect of differential
pricing on various players in the Internet. We consider a model with a single
ISP and multiple CPs where users select CPs based on the quality of service
(QoS) and applicable traffic charges. We show that in a differential pricing
regime 1) a CP offering low QoS can make more revenues than a CP offering
better QoS through sponsorships. 2) QoS (mean delay) for end users can degrade
compared to the case where no differential pricing is allowed.

    <title>Single market nonparametric identification of multi-attribute hedonic
  equilibrium models</title>
    <summary>  This paper derives conditions under which preferences and technology are
nonparametrically identified in hedonic equilibrium models, where products are
differentiated along more than one dimension and agents are characterized by
several dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity. With products differentiated
along a quality index and agents characterized by scalar unobserved
heterogeneity, single crossing conditions on preferences and technology provide
identifying restrictions. We develop similar shape restrictions in the
multi-attribute case. These shape restrictions, which are based on optimal
transport theory and generalized convexity, allow us to identify preferences
for goods differentiated along multiple dimensions, from the observation of a
single market. We thereby extend identification results in Matzkin (2003) and
Heckman, Matzkin and Nesheim (2004) to accommodate multiple dimensions of
unobserved heterogeneity. One of our results is a proof of absolute continuity
of the distribution of endogenously traded qualities, which is of independent
interest.

    <title>Estimation of Graphical Models using the $L_{1,2}$ Norm</title>
    <summary>  Gaussian graphical models are recently used in economics to obtain networks
of dependence among agents. A widely-used estimator is the Graphical Lasso
(GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using
the $L_{1,1}$ matrix norm on the precision matrix $\Omega$. The $L_{1,1}$ norm
is a lasso penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in
$\Omega$. We propose a new estimator called Structured Graphical Lasso
(SGLASSO) that uses the $L_{1,2}$ mixed norm. The use of the $L_{1,2}$ penalty
controls for the structure of the sparsity in $\Omega$. We show that when the
network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible
GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes.
Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of
estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the
structure of the graphical model. In an empirical illustration using a classic
firms' investment dataset, we obtain a network of firms' dependence that
exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric
and U.S. Steel forming the core group of firms.

    <title>Forecasting with Dynamic Panel Data Models</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers the problem of forecasting a collection of short time
series using cross sectional information in panel data. We construct point
predictors using Tweedie's formula for the posterior mean of heterogeneous
coefficients under a correlated random effects distribution. This formula
utilizes cross-sectional information to transform the unit-specific (quasi)
maximum likelihood estimator into an approximation of the posterior mean under
a prior distribution that equals the population distribution of the random
coefficients. We show that the risk of a predictor based on a non-parametric
estimate of the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of
a predictor that treats the correlated-random-effects distribution as known
(ratio-optimality). Our empirical Bayes predictor performs well compared to
various competitors in a Monte Carlo study. In an empirical application we use
the predictor to forecast revenues for a large panel of bank holding companies
and compare forecasts that condition on actual and severely adverse
macroeconomic conditions.

    <title>Inference for VARs Identified with Sign Restrictions</title>
    <summary>  There is a fast growing literature that set-identifies structural vector
autoregressions (SVARs) by imposing sign restrictions on the responses of a
subset of the endogenous variables to a particular structural shock
(sign-restricted SVARs). Most methods that have been used to construct
pointwise coverage bands for impulse responses of sign-restricted SVARs are
justified only from a Bayesian perspective. This paper demonstrates how to
formulate the inference problem for sign-restricted SVARs within a
moment-inequality framework. In particular, it develops methods of constructing
confidence bands for impulse response functions of sign-restricted SVARs that
are valid from a frequentist perspective. The paper also provides a comparison
of frequentist and Bayesian coverage bands in the context of an empirical
application - the former can be substantially wider than the latter.

    <title>A Justification of Conditional Confidence Intervals</title>
    <summary>  To quantify uncertainty around point estimates of conditional objects such as
conditional means or variances, parameter uncertainty has to be taken into
account. Attempts to incorporate parameter uncertainty are typically based on
the unrealistic assumption of observing two independent processes, where one is
used for parameter estimation, and the other for conditioning upon. Such
unrealistic foundation raises the question whether these intervals are
theoretically justified in a realistic setting. This paper presents an
asymptotic justification for this type of intervals that does not require such
an unrealistic assumption, but relies on a sample-split approach instead. By
showing that our sample-split intervals coincide asymptotically with the
standard intervals, we provide a novel, and realistic, justification for
confidence intervals of conditional objects. The analysis is carried out for a
general class of Markov chains nesting various time series models.

    <title>High Dimensional Sparse Econometric Models: An Introduction</title>
    <summary>  In this chapter we discuss conceptually high dimensional sparse econometric
models as well as estimation of these models using L1-penalization and
post-L1-penalization methods. Focusing on linear and nonparametric regression
frameworks, we discuss various econometric examples, present basic theoretical
results, and illustrate the concepts and methods with Monte Carlo simulations
and an empirical application. In the application, we examine and confirm the
empirical validity of the Solow-Swan model for international economic growth.

    <title>Quantile Models with Endogeneity</title>
    <summary>  In this article, we review quantile models with endogeneity. We focus on
models that achieve identification through the use of instrumental variables
and discuss conditions under which partial and point identification are
obtained. We discuss key conditions, which include monotonicity and
full-rank-type conditions, in detail. In providing this review, we update the
identification results of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005, Econometrica). We
illustrate the modeling assumptions through economically motivated examples. We
also briefly review the literature on estimation and inference.

    <title>Individual and Time Effects in Nonlinear Panel Models with Large N, T</title>
    <summary>  We derive fixed effects estimators of parameters and average partial effects
in (possibly dynamic) nonlinear panel data models with individual and time
effects. They cover logit, probit, ordered probit, Poisson and Tobit models
that are important for many empirical applications in micro and macroeconomics.
Our estimators use analytical and jackknife bias corrections to deal with the
incidental parameter problem, and are asymptotically unbiased under asymptotic
sequences where $N/T$ converges to a constant. We develop inference methods and
show that they perform well in numerical examples.

    <title>Applications of James-Stein Shrinkage (I): Variance Reduction without
  Bias</title>
    <summary>  In a linear regression model with homoscedastic Normal noise, I consider
James-Stein type shrinkage in the estimation of nuisance parameters associated
with control variables. For at least three control variables and exogenous
treatment, I show that the standard least-squares estimator is dominated with
respect to squared-error loss in the treatment effect even among unbiased
estimators and even when the target parameter is low-dimensional. I construct
the dominating estimator by a variant of James-Stein shrinkage in an
appropriate high-dimensional Normal-means problem; it can be understood as an
invariant generalized Bayes estimator with an uninformative (improper) Jeffreys
prior in the target parameter.

    <title>Inference for Impulse Responses under Model Uncertainty</title>
    <summary>  In many macroeconomic applications, impulse responses and their (bootstrap)
confidence intervals are constructed by estimating a VAR model in levels - thus
ignoring uncertainty regarding the true (unknown) cointegration rank. While it
is well known that using a wrong cointegration rank leads to invalid
(bootstrap) inference, we demonstrate that even if the rank is consistently
estimated, ignoring uncertainty regarding the true rank can make inference
highly unreliable for sample sizes encountered in macroeconomic applications.
We investigate the effects of rank uncertainty in a simulation study, comparing
several methods designed for handling model uncertainty. We propose a new
method - Weighted Inference by Model Plausibility (WIMP) - that takes rank
uncertainty into account in a fully data-driven way and outperforms all other
methods considered in the simulation study. The WIMP method is shown to deliver
intervals that are robust to rank uncertainty, yet allow for meaningful
inference, approaching fixed rank intervals when evidence for a particular rank
is strong. We study the potential ramifications of rank uncertainty on applied
macroeconomic analysis by re-assessing the effects of fiscal policy shocks
based on a variety of identification schemes that have been considered in the
literature. We demonstrate how sensitive the results are to the treatment of
the cointegration rank, and show how formally accounting for rank uncertainty
can affect the conclusions.

    <title>Rate-Optimal Estimation of the Intercept in a Semiparametric
  Sample-Selection Model</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a new estimator of the intercept of a sample-selection
model in which the joint distribution of the unobservables is unspecified. The
intercept is often in this context of inherent interest; for example, in a
program evaluation context, the difference between the intercepts in outcome
equations for participants and non-participants can be interpreted as the
difference in average outcomes of participants and their counterfactual average
outcomes if they had chosen not to participate. The new estimator can under
mild conditions exhibit a rate of convergence in probability equal to
$n^{-(p-1)/(2p-1)}$, where $p\ge 2$ is an integer that indexes the strength of
certain smoothness assumptions. This rate of convergence is in this context the
optimal rate of convergence for estimation of the intercept parameter in terms
of a minimax criterion. The new estimator is an adaptation of a
nearest-neighbours estimator of a conditional mean (Yang, 1981; Stute, 1984),
and is under mild conditions consistent and asymptotically normal with a rate
of convergence that is the same regardless of the degree to which selection
depends on unobservables in the outcome equation. The first-order behaviour of
the new estimator, unlike those of other proposals in the literature, does not
depend on explicit assumptions regarding the relative tail behaviours of the
determinants of selection. Simulation evidence and an empirical example are
included.

    <title>Extremal quantile regression</title>
    <summary>  Quantile regression is an important tool for estimation of conditional
quantiles of a response Y given a vector of covariates X. It can be used to
measure the effect of covariates not only in the center of a distribution, but
also in the upper and lower tails. This paper develops a theory of quantile
regression in the tails. Specifically, it obtains the large sample properties
of extremal (extreme order and intermediate order) quantile regression
estimators for the linear quantile regression model with the tails restricted
to the domain of minimum attraction and closed under tail equivalence across
regressor values. This modeling setup combines restrictions of extreme value
theory with leading homoscedastic and heteroscedastic linear specifications of
regression analysis. In large samples, extreme order regression quantiles
converge weakly to \argmin functionals of stochastic integrals of Poisson
processes that depend on regressors, while intermediate regression quantiles
and their functionals converge to normal vectors with variance matrices
dependent on the tail parameters and the regressor design.

    <title>Posterior Inference in Curved Exponential Families under Increasing
  Dimensions</title>
    <summary>  This work studies the large sample properties of the posterior-based
inference in the curved exponential family under increasing dimension. The
curved structure arises from the imposition of various restrictions on the
model, such as moment restrictions, and plays a fundamental role in
econometrics and others branches of data analysis. We establish conditions
under which the posterior distribution is approximately normal, which in turn
implies various good properties of estimation and inference procedures based on
the posterior. In the process we also revisit and improve upon previous results
for the exponential family under increasing dimension by making use of
concentration of measure. We also discuss a variety of applications to
high-dimensional versions of the classical econometric models including the
multinomial model with moment restrictions, seemingly unrelated regression
equations, and single structural equation models. In our analysis, both the
parameter dimension and the number of moments are increasing with the sample
size.

    <title>LASSO Methods for Gaussian Instrumental Variables Models</title>
    <summary>  In this note, we propose to use sparse methods (e.g. LASSO, Post-LASSO,
sqrt-LASSO, and Post-sqrt-LASSO) to form first-stage predictions and estimate
optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many
instruments in the canonical Gaussian case. The methods apply even when the
number of instruments is much larger than the sample size. We derive asymptotic
distributions for the resulting IV estimators and provide conditions under
which these sparsity-based IV estimators are asymptotically oracle-efficient.
In simulation experiments, a sparsity-based IV estimator with a data-driven
penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust
procedures. We illustrate the procedure in an empirical example using the
Angrist and Krueger (1991) schooling data.

    <title>Inference for High-Dimensional Sparse Econometric Models</title>
    <summary>  This article is about estimation and inference methods for high dimensional
sparse (HDS) regression models in econometrics. High dimensional sparse models
arise in situations where many regressors (or series terms) are available and
the regression function is well-approximated by a parsimonious, yet unknown set
of regressors. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the entire
regression function effectively by searching for approximately the right set of
regressors. We discuss methods for identifying this set of regressors and
estimating their coefficients based on $\ell_1$-penalization and describe key
theoretical results. In order to capture realistic practical situations, we
expressly allow for imperfect selection of regressors and study the impact of
this imperfect selection on estimation and inference results. We focus the main
part of the article on the use of HDS models and methods in the instrumental
variables model and the partially linear model. We present a set of novel
inference results for these models and illustrate their use with applications
to returns to schooling and growth regression.

    <title>Uniform Post Selection Inference for LAD Regression and Other
  Z-estimation problems</title>
    <summary>  We develop uniformly valid confidence regions for regression coefficients in
a high-dimensional sparse median regression model with homoscedastic errors.
Our methods are based on a moment equation that is immunized against
non-regular estimation of the nuisance part of the median regression function
by using Neyman's orthogonalization. We establish that the resulting
instrumental median regression estimator of a target regression coefficient is
asymptotically normally distributed uniformly with respect to the underlying
sparse model and is semi-parametrically efficient. We also generalize our
method to a general non-smooth Z-estimation framework with the number of target
parameters $p_1$ being possibly much larger than the sample size $n$. We extend
Huber's results on asymptotic normality to this setting, demonstrating uniform
asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators over $p_1$-dimensional
rectangles, constructing simultaneous confidence bands on all of the $p_1$
target parameters, and establishing asymptotic validity of the bands uniformly
over underlying approximately sparse models.

    <title>Optimal Uniform Convergence Rates for Sieve Nonparametric Instrumental
  Variables Regression</title>
    <summary>  We study the problem of nonparametric regression when the regressor is
endogenous, which is an important nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV)
regression in econometrics and a difficult ill-posed inverse problem with
unknown operator in statistics. We first establish a general upper bound on the
sup-norm (uniform) convergence rate of a sieve estimator, allowing for
endogenous regressors and weakly dependent data. This result leads to the
optimal sup-norm convergence rates for spline and wavelet least squares
regression estimators under weakly dependent data and heavy-tailed error terms.
This upper bound also yields the sup-norm convergence rates for sieve NPIV
estimators under i.i.d. data: the rates coincide with the known optimal
$L^2$-norm rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are power of $\log(n)$
slower than the optimal $L^2$-norm rates for mildly ill-posed problems. We then
establish the minimax risk lower bound in sup-norm loss, which coincides with
our upper bounds on sup-norm rates for the spline and wavelet sieve NPIV
estimators. This sup-norm rate optimality provides another justification for
the wide application of sieve NPIV estimators. Useful results on
weakly-dependent random matrices are also provided.

    <title>Valid Post-Selection Inference in High-Dimensional Approximately Sparse
  Quantile Regression Models</title>
    <summary>  This work proposes new inference methods for a regression coefficient of
interest in a (heterogeneous) quantile regression model. We consider a
high-dimensional model where the number of regressors potentially exceeds the
sample size but a subset of them suffice to construct a reasonable
approximation to the conditional quantile function. The proposed methods are
(explicitly or implicitly) based on orthogonal score functions that protect
against moderate model selection mistakes, which are often inevitable in the
approximately sparse model considered in the present paper. We establish the
uniform validity of the proposed confidence regions for the quantile regression
coefficient. Importantly, these methods directly apply to more than one
variable and a continuum of quantile indices. In addition, the performance of
the proposed methods is illustrated through Monte-Carlo experiments and an
empirical example, dealing with risk factors in childhood malnutrition.

    <title>Nonlinear Panel Models with Interactive Effects</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers estimation and inference on semiparametric nonlinear
panel single index models with predetermined explanatory variables and
interactive individual and time effects. These include static and dynamic
probit, logit, and Poisson models. Fixed effects conditional maximum likelihood
estimation is challenging because the log likelihood function is not concave in
the individual and time effects. We propose an iterative two-step procedure to
maximize the likelihood that is concave in each step. Under asymptotic
sequences where both the cross section and time series dimensions of the panel
pass to infinity at the same rate, we show that the fixed effects conditional
maximum likelihood estimator is consistent, but it has bias in the asymptotic
distribution due to the incidental parameter problem. We characterize the bias
and develop analytical and jackknife bias corrections that remove the bias from
the asymptotic distribution without increasing variance. In numerical examples,
we find that the corrections substantially reduce the bias and rmse of the
estimator in small samples, and produce confidence intervals with coverages
that are close to their nominal levels.

    <title>Monge-Kantorovich Depth, Quantiles, Ranks, and Signs</title>
    <summary>  We propose new concepts of statistical depth, multivariate quantiles, ranks
and signs, based on canonical transportation maps between a distribution of
interest on $R^d$ and a reference distribution on the $d$-dimensional unit
ball. The new depth concept, called Monge-Kantorovich depth, specializes to
halfspace depth in the case of spherical distributions, but, for more general
distributions, differs from the latter in the ability for its contours to
account for non convex features of the distribution of interest. We propose
empirical counterparts to the population versions of those Monge-Kantorovich
depth contours, quantiles, ranks and signs, and show their consistency by
establishing a uniform convergence property for empirical transport maps, which
is of independent interest.

    <title>Post-Selection and Post-Regularization Inference in Linear Models with
  Many Controls and Instruments</title>
    <summary>  In this note, we offer an approach to estimating causal/structural parameters
in the presence of many instruments and controls based on methods for
estimating sparse high-dimensional models. We use these high-dimensional
methods to select both which instruments and which control variables to use.
The approach we take extends BCCH2012, which covers selection of instruments
for IV models with a small number of controls, and extends BCH2014, which
covers selection of controls in models where the variable of interest is
exogenous conditional on observables, to accommodate both a large number of
controls and a large number of instruments. We illustrate the approach with a
simulation and an empirical example. Technical supporting material is available
in a supplementary online appendix.

    <title>Nonparametric instrumental variable estimation under monotonicity</title>
    <summary>  The ill-posedness of the inverse problem of recovering a regression function
in a nonparametric instrumental variable model leads to estimators that may
suffer from a very slow, logarithmic rate of convergence. In this paper, we
show that restricting the problem to models with monotone regression functions
and monotone instruments significantly weakens the ill-posedness of the
problem. In stark contrast to the existing literature, the presence of a
monotone instrument implies boundedness of our measure of ill-posedness when
restricted to the space of monotone functions. Based on this result we derive a
novel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator that imposes
monotonicity of the regression function. For a given sample size, the bound is
independent of the degree of ill-posedness as long as the regression function
is not too steep. As an implication, the bound allows us to show that the
constrained estimator converges at a fast, polynomial rate, independently of
the degree of ill-posedness, in a large, but slowly shrinking neighborhood of
constant functions. Our simulation study demonstrates significant finite-sample
performance gains from imposing monotonicity even when the regression function
is rather far from being a constant. We apply the constrained estimator to the
problem of estimating gasoline demand functions from U.S. data.

    <title>Optimal Data Collection for Randomized Control Trials</title>
    <summary>  In a randomized control trial, the precision of an average treatment effect
estimator can be improved either by collecting data on additional individuals,
or by collecting additional covariates that predict the outcome variable. We
propose the use of pre-experimental data such as a census, or a household
survey, to inform the choice of both the sample size and the covariates to be
collected. Our procedure seeks to minimize the resulting average treatment
effect estimator's mean squared error, subject to the researcher's budget
constraint. We rely on a modification of an orthogonal greedy algorithm that is
conceptually simple and easy to implement in the presence of a large number of
potential covariates, and does not require any tuning parameters. In two
empirical applications, we show that our procedure can lead to substantial
gains of up to 58%, measured either in terms of reductions in data collection
costs or in terms of improvements in the precision of the treatment effect
estimator.

    <title>Robust Factor Models with Explanatory Proxies</title>
    <summary>  We provide an econometric analysis for the factor models when the latent
factors can be explained partially by several observed explanatory proxies. In
financial factor models for instance, the unknown factors can be reasonably
well predicted by a few observable proxies, such as the Fama-French factors. In
diffusion index forecasts, identified factors are strongly related to several
directly measurable economic variables such as consumption-wealth variable,
financial ratios, and term spread. To incorporate the explanatory power of
these observed characteristics, we propose a new two-step estimation procedure:
(i) regress the data onto the observables, and (ii) take the principal
components of the fitted data to estimate the loadings and factors. The
proposed estimator is robust to possibly heavy-tailed distributions, which are
encountered by many macroeconomic and financial time series. With those
proxies, the factors can be estimated accurately even if the cross-sectional
dimension is mild. Empirically, we apply the model to forecast US bond risk
premia, and find that the observed macroeconomic characteristics contain strong
explanatory powers of the factors. The gain of forecast is more substantial
when these characteristics are incorporated to estimate the common factors than
directly used for forecasts.

    <title>Program Evaluation with Right-Censored Data</title>
    <summary>  In a unified framework, we provide estimators and confidence bands for a
variety of treatment effects when the outcome of interest, typically a
duration, is subjected to right censoring. Our methodology accommodates
average, distributional, and quantile treatment effects under different
identifying assumptions including unconfoundedness, local treatment effects,
and nonlinear differences-in-differences. The proposed estimators are easy to
implement, have close-form representation, are fully data-driven upon
estimation of nuisance parameters, and do not rely on parametric distributional
assumptions, shape restrictions, or on restricting the potential treatment
effect heterogeneity across different subpopulations. These treatment effects
results are obtained as a consequence of more general results on two-step
Kaplan-Meier estimators that are of independent interest: we provide conditions
for applying (i) uniform law of large numbers, (ii) functional central limit
theorems, and (iii) we prove the validity of the ordinary nonparametric
bootstrap in a two-step estimation procedure where the outcome of interest may
be randomly censored.

    <title>Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models</title>
    <summary>  This paper develops and implements a nonparametric test of Random Utility
Models. The motivating application is to test the null hypothesis that a sample
of cross-sectional demand distributions was generated by a population of
rational consumers. We test a necessary and sufficient condition for this that
does not rely on any restriction on unobserved heterogeneity or the number of
goods. We also propose and implement a control function approach to account for
endogenous expenditure. An econometric result of independent interest is a test
for linear inequality constraints when these are represented as the vertices of
a polyhedron rather than its faces. An empirical application to the U.K.
Household Expenditure Survey illustrates computational feasibility of the
method in demand problems with 5 goods.

    <title>Locally Robust Semiparametric Estimation</title>
    <summary>  This paper shows how to construct locally robust semiparametric GMM
estimators, meaning equivalently moment conditions have zero derivative with
respect to the first step and the first step does not affect the asymptotic
variance. They are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustment
term for first step estimation. Locally robust estimators have several
advantages. They are vital for valid inference with machine learning in the
first step, see Belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to the
specification of the first step. They are doubly robust for affine moment
functions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one first step component
is incorrect. Locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that is
flatter as a function of first step smoothing leading to improved small sample
properties. Series first step estimators confer local robustness on any moment
conditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, in the direction of the
series approximation. Many new locally and doubly robust estimators are given
here, including for economic structural models. We give simple asymptotic
theory for estimators that use cross-fitting in the first step, including
machine learning.

    <title>hdm: High-Dimensional Metrics</title>
    <summary>  In this article the package High-dimensional Metrics (\texttt{hdm}) is
introduced. It is a collection of statistical methods for estimation and
quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately sparse models.
It focuses on providing confidence intervals and significance testing for
(possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional parameter
vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for
regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or policy
variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for
average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated
(ATET), as well for extensions of these parameters to the endogenous setting
are provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the
penalization parameter in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and
non-Gaussian errors are implemented. Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence
intervals for regression coefficients of a high-dimensional sparse regression
are implemented. Data sets which have been used in the literature and might be
useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new estimators are included.

    <title>Fixed-Effect Regressions on Network Data</title>
    <summary>  This paper studies inference on fixed effects in a linear regression model
estimated from network data. An important special case of our setup is the
two-way regression model, which is a workhorse method in the analysis of
matched data sets. Networks are typically quite sparse and it is difficult to
see how the data carry information about certain parameters. We derive bounds
on the variance of the fixed-effect estimator that uncover the importance of
the structure of the network. These bounds depend on the smallest non-zero
eigenvalue of the (normalized) Laplacian of the network and on the degree
structure of the network. The Laplacian is a matrix that describes the network
and its smallest non-zero eigenvalue is a measure of connectivity, with smaller
values indicating less-connected networks. These bounds yield conditions for
consistent estimation and convergence rates, and allow to evaluate the accuracy
of first-order approximations to the variance of the fixed-effect estimator.
The bounds are also used to assess the bias and variance of estimators of
moments of the fixed effects.

    <title>Specification Tests for the Propensity Score</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces new nonparametric diagnostic tools for detecting
propensity score misspecification. These tests may be applied to assess the
validity of different treatment effects estimators that rely on the correct
specification of the propensity score. Our tests do not suffer from the "curse
of dimensionality" when the vector of covariates is of high-dimensionality, are
fully data-driven, do not require tuning parameters such as bandwidths, and are
able to detect a broad class of local alternatives converging to the null at
the parametric rate $n^{-1/2}$, with $n$ the sample size. We show that the use
of an orthogonal projection on the tangent space of nuisance parameters both
improves power and facilitates the simulation of critical values by means of a
multiplier bootstrap procedure. The finite sample performance of the tests are
examined by means of a Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical application.
Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed tests.

    <title>Nonparametric Tests for Treatment Effect Heterogeneity with Duration
  Outcomes</title>
    <summary>  This article proposes different tests for treatment effect heterogeneity when
the outcome of interest, typically a duration variable, may be right-censored.
The proposed tests study whether a policy 1) has zero distributional (average)
effect for all subpopulations defined by covariate values, and 2) has
homogeneous average effect across different subpopulations. The proposed tests
are based on two-step Kaplan-Meier integrals, and do not rely on parametric
distributional assumptions, shape restrictions, nor on restricting the
potential treatment effect heterogeneity across different subpopulations. Our
framework is suitable not only to exogenous treatment allocation, but can also
account for treatment noncompliance, an important feature in many applications.
The proposed tests are consistent against fixed alternatives, and can detect
nonparametric alternatives converging to the null at the parametric
$n^{-1/2}$-rate, $n$ being the sample size. Critical values are computed with
the assistance of a multiplier bootstrap. The finite sample properties of the
proposed tests are examined by means of a Monte Carlo study, and an application
about the effect of labor market programs on unemployment duration. Open-source
software is available for implementing all proposed tests.

    <title>Extremal Quantile Regression: An Overview</title>
    <summary>  Extremal quantile regression, i.e. quantile regression applied to the tails
of the conditional distribution, counts with an increasing number of economic
and financial applications such as value-at-risk, production frontiers,
determinants of low infant birth weights, and auction models. This chapter
provides an overview of recent developments in the theory and empirics of
extremal quantile regression. The advances in the theory have relied on the use
of extreme value approximations to the law of the Koenker and Bassett (1978)
quantile regression estimator. Extreme value laws not only have been shown to
provide more accurate approximations than Gaussian laws at the tails, but also
have served as the basis to develop bias corrected estimators and inference
methods using simulation and suitable variations of bootstrap and subsampling.
The applicability of these methods is illustrated with two empirical examples
on conditional value-at-risk and financial contagion.

    <title>Nonseparable Multinomial Choice Models in Cross-Section and Panel Data</title>
    <summary>  Multinomial choice models are fundamental for empirical modeling of economic
choices among discrete alternatives. We analyze identification of binary and
multinomial choice models when the choice utilities are nonseparable in
observed attributes and multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity with
cross-section and panel data. We show that derivatives of choice probabilities
with respect to continuous attributes are weighted averages of utility
derivatives in cross-section models with exogenous heterogeneity. In the
special case of random coefficient models with an independent additive effect,
we further characterize that the probability derivative at zero is proportional
to the population mean of the coefficients. We extend the identification
results to models with endogenous heterogeneity using either a control function
or panel data. In time stationary panel models with two periods, we find that
differences over time of derivatives of choice probabilities identify utility
derivatives "on the diagonal," i.e. when the observed attributes take the same
values in the two periods. We also show that time stationarity does not
identify structural derivatives "off the diagonal" both in continuous and
multinomial choice panel models.

    <title>Counterparty credit limits: An effective tool for mitigating
  counterparty risk?</title>
    <summary>  A counterparty credit limit (CCL) is a limit imposed by a financial
institution to cap its maximum possible exposure to a specified counterparty.
Although CCLs are designed to help institutions mitigate counterparty risk by
selective diversification of their exposures, their implementation restricts
the liquidity that institutions can access in an otherwise centralized pool. We
address the question of how this mechanism impacts trade prices and volatility,
both empirically and via a new model of trading with CCLs. We find empirically
that CCLs cause little impact on trade. However, our model highlights that in
extreme situations, CCLs could serve to destabilize prices and thereby
influence systemic risk.

    <title>Finite Time Identification in Unstable Linear Systems</title>
    <summary>  Identification of the parameters of stable linear dynamical systems is a
well-studied problem in the literature, both in the low and high-dimensional
settings. However, there are hardly any results for the unstable case,
especially regarding finite time bounds. For this setting, classical results on
least-squares estimation of the dynamics parameters are not applicable and
therefore new concepts and technical approaches need to be developed to address
the issue. Unstable linear systems reflect key real applications in control
theory, econometrics, and finance.
  This study establishes finite time bounds for the identification error of the
least-squares estimates for a fairly large class of heavy-tailed noise
distributions, and transition matrices of such systems. The results relate the
time length required as a function of the problem dimension and key
characteristics of the true underlying transition matrix and the noise
distribution. To obtain them, appropriate concentration inequalities for random
matrices and for sequences of martingale differences are leveraged.

    <title>Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a method to address the longstanding problem of lack of
monotonicity in estimation of conditional and structural quantile functions,
also known as the quantile crossing problem. The method consists in sorting or
monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone
rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true
quantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a
functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive
functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We
also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the
the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic
in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,
provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and
the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results
apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity
restrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural
distribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to
estimation of structural quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran
status and earnings.

    <title>Inference on Treatment Effects After Selection Amongst High-Dimensional
  Controls</title>
    <summary>  We propose robust methods for inference on the effect of a treatment variable
on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many controls. Our setting is a
partially linear model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic
disturbances. Our analysis allows the number of controls to be much larger than
the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model
to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding
factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by conditioning
on a relatively small number of controls whose identities are unknown. The
latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by
selecting approximately the right set of controls. We develop a novel
estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in
this setting, called the "post-double-selection" method. Our results apply to
Lasso-type methods used for covariate selection as well as to any other model
selection method that is able to find a sparse model with good approximation
properties.
  The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect
selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid
uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model
selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases
with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus our method resolves the problem of
uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of
models. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical
simulations and an application to the effect of abortion on crime rates.

partial identification has mostly focused on the structural parameter, our
primary focus is on Bayesian credible sets (BCS's) of the unknown identified
set and the posterior distribution of its support function. We construct a
(two-sided) BCS based on the support function of the identified set. We prove
the Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the support
function. This powerful result in turn infers that, while the BCS and the
frequentist confidence set for the partially identified parameter are
asymptotically different, our constructed BCS for the identified set has an
asymptotically correct frequentist coverage probability. Importantly, we
illustrate that the constructed BCS for the identified set does not require a
prior on the structural parameter. It can be computed efficiently for subset
inference, especially when the target of interest is a sub-vector of the
partially identified parameter, where projecting to a low-dimensional subset is
often required. Hence, the proposed methods are useful in many applications.
  The Bayesian partial identification literature has been assuming a known
parametric likelihood function. However, econometric models usually only
identify a set of moment inequalities, and therefore using an incorrect
likelihood function may result in misleading inferences. In contrast, with a
nonparametric prior on the unknown likelihood function, our proposed Bayesian
procedure only requires a set of moment conditions, and can efficiently make
inference about both the partially identified parameter and its identified set.
This makes it widely applicable in general moment inequality models. Finally,
the proposed method is illustrated in a financial asset pricing problem.

    <title>Post-Selection Inference for Generalized Linear Models with Many
  Controls</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers generalized linear models in the presence of many
controls. We lay out a general methodology to estimate an effect of interest
based on the construction of an instrument that immunize against model
selection mistakes and apply it to the case of logistic binary choice model.
More specifically we propose new methods for estimating and constructing
confidence regions for a regression parameter of primary interest $\alpha_0$, a
parameter in front of the regressor of interest, such as the treatment variable
or a policy variable. These methods allow to estimate $\alpha_0$ at the
root-$n$ rate when the total number $p$ of other regressors, called controls,
potentially exceed the sample size $n$ using sparsity assumptions. The sparsity
assumption means that there is a subset of $s&lt;n$ controls which suffices to
accurately approximate the nuisance part of the regression function.
Importantly, the estimators and these resulting confidence regions are valid
uniformly over $s$-sparse models satisfying $s^2\log^2 p = o(n)$ and other
technical conditions. These procedures do not rely on traditional consistent
model selection arguments for their validity. In fact, they are robust with
respect to moderate model selection mistakes in variable selection. Under
suitable conditions, the estimators are semi-parametrically efficient in the
sense of attaining the semi-parametric efficiency bounds for the class of
models in this paper.

    <title>Program Evaluation and Causal Inference with High-Dimensional Data</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we provide efficient estimators and honest confidence bands
for a variety of treatment effects including local average (LATE) and local
quantile treatment effects (LQTE) in data-rich environments. We can handle very
many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous
treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the
special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls
or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our
approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional)
average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make
informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced form predictive
relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of
regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we
provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are
uniformly valid (honest) across a wide-range of models. We show that a key
ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust
moment conditions in estimating certain reduced form functional parameters. We
illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating
the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets.

    <title>Inference in High Dimensional Panel Models with an Application to Gun
  Control</title>
    <summary>  We consider estimation and inference in panel data models with additive
unobserved individual specific heterogeneity in a high dimensional setting. The
setting allows the number of time varying regressors to be larger than the
sample size. To make informative estimation and inference feasible, we require
that the overall contribution of the time varying variables after eliminating
the individual specific heterogeneity can be captured by a relatively small
number of the available variables whose identities are unknown. This
restriction allows the problem of estimation to proceed as a variable selection
problem. Importantly, we treat the individual specific heterogeneity as fixed
effects which allows this heterogeneity to be related to the observed time
varying variables in an unspecified way and allows that this heterogeneity may
be non-zero for all individuals. Within this framework, we provide procedures
that give uniformly valid inference over a fixed subset of parameters in the
canonical linear fixed effects model and over coefficients on a fixed vector of
endogenous variables in panel data instrumental variables models with fixed
effects and many instruments. An input to developing the properties of our
proposed procedures is the use of a variant of the Lasso estimator that allows
for a grouped data structure where data across groups are independent and
dependence within groups is unrestricted. We provide formal conditions within
this structure under which the proposed Lasso variant selects a sparse model
with good approximation properties. We present simulation results in support of
the theoretical developments and illustrate the use of the methods in an
application aimed at estimating the effect of gun prevalence on crime rates.

    <title>A lava attack on the recovery of sums of dense and sparse signals</title>
    <summary>  Common high-dimensional methods for prediction rely on having either a sparse
signal model, a model in which most parameters are zero and there are a small
number of non-zero parameters that are large in magnitude, or a dense signal
model, a model with no large parameters and very many small non-zero
parameters. We consider a generalization of these two basic models, termed here
a "sparse+dense" model, in which the signal is given by the sum of a sparse
signal and a dense signal. Such a structure poses problems for traditional
sparse estimators, such as the lasso, and for traditional dense estimation
methods, such as ridge estimation. We propose a new penalization-based method,
called lava, which is computationally efficient. With suitable choices of
penalty parameters, the proposed method strictly dominates both lasso and
ridge. We derive analytic expressions for the finite-sample risk function of
the lava estimator in the Gaussian sequence model. We also provide an deviation
bound for the prediction risk in the Gaussian regression model with fixed
design. In both cases, we provide Stein's unbiased estimator for lava's
prediction risk. A simulation example compares the performance of lava to
lasso, ridge, and elastic net in a regression example using feasible,
data-dependent penalty parameters and illustrates lava's improved performance
relative to these benchmarks.

    <title>Confidence Intervals for Projections of Partially Identified Parameters</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a bootstrap-based procedure to build confidence intervals
for single components of a partially identified parameter vector, and for
smooth functions of such components, in moment (in)equality models. The extreme
points of our confidence interval are obtained by maximizing/minimizing the
value of the component (or function) of interest subject to the sample analog
of the moment (in)equality conditions properly relaxed. The novelty is that the
amount of relaxation, or critical level, is computed so that the component of
$\theta$, instead of $\theta$ itself, is uniformly asymptotically covered with
prespecified probability. Calibration of the critical level is based on
repeatedly checking feasibility of linear programming problems, rendering it
computationally attractive. Computation of the extreme points of the confidence
interval is based on a novel application of the response surface method for
global optimization, which may prove of independent interest also for
applications of other methods of inference in the moment (in)equalities
literature. The critical level is by construction smaller (in finite sample)
than the one used if projecting confidence regions designed to cover the entire
parameter vector $\theta $. Hence, our confidence interval is weakly shorter
than the projection of established confidence sets (Andrews and Soares, 2010),
if one holds the choice of tuning parameters constant. We provide simple
conditions under which the comparison is strict. Our inference method controls
asymptotic coverage uniformly over a large class of data generating processes.
Our assumptions and those used in the leading alternative approach (a profiling
based method) are not nested. We explain why we employ some restrictions that
are not required by other methods and provide examples of models for which our
method is uniformly valid but profiling based methods are not.

    <title>High-Dimensional $L_2$Boosting: Rate of Convergence</title>
    <summary>  Boosting is one of the most significant developments in machine learning.
This paper studies the rate of convergence of $L_2$Boosting, which is tailored
for regression, in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover, we introduce so-called
\textquotedblleft post-Boosting\textquotedblright. This is a post-selection
estimator which applies ordinary least squares to the variables selected in the
first stage by $L_2$Boosting. Another variant is \textquotedblleft Orthogonal
Boosting\textquotedblright\ where after each step an orthogonal projection is
conducted. We show that both post-$L_2$Boosting and the orthogonal boosting
achieve the same rate of convergence as LASSO in a sparse, high-dimensional
setting. We show that the rate of convergence of the classical $L_2$Boosting
depends on the design matrix described by a sparse eigenvalue constant. To show
the latter results, we derive new approximation results for the pure greedy
algorithm, based on analyzing the revisiting behavior of $L_2$Boosting. We also
introduce feasible rules for early stopping, which can be easily implemented
and used in applied work. Our results also allow a direct comparison between
LASSO and boosting which has been missing from the literature. Finally, we
present simulation studies and applications to illustrate the relevance of our
theoretical results and to provide insights into the practical aspects of
boosting. In these simulation studies, post-$L_2$Boosting clearly outperforms
LASSO.

    <title>High-Dimensional Metrics in R</title>
    <summary>  The package High-dimensional Metrics (\Rpackage{hdm}) is an evolving
collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of
uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on
providing confidence intervals and significance testing for (possibly many)
low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional parameter vector.
Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for regression
coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or policy variable) in a
high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for average treatment
effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated (ATET), as well for
extensions of these parameters to the endogenous setting are provided. Theory
grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter in Lasso
regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented.
Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients
of a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented, including a joint
significance test for Lasso regression. Data sets which have been used in the
literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new
estimators are included. \R and the package \Rpackage{hdm} are open-source
software projects and can be freely downloaded from CRAN:
\texttt{http://cran.r-project.org}.

    <title>Monte Carlo Confidence Sets for Identified Sets</title>
    <summary>  In complicated/nonlinear parametric models, it is generally hard to know
whether the model parameters are point identified. We provide computationally
attractive procedures to construct confidence sets (CSs) for identified sets of
full parameters and of subvectors in models defined through a likelihood or a
vector of moment equalities or inequalities. These CSs are based on level sets
of optimal sample criterion functions (such as likelihood or optimally-weighted
or continuously-updated GMM criterions). The level sets are constructed using
cutoffs that are computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations directly from the
quasi-posterior distributions of the criterions. We establish new Bernstein-von
Mises (or Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions
of the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified
regular models and some non-regular models. These results imply that our MC CSs
have exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets of full
parameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have
valid but potentially conservative coverage in models with reduced-form
parameters on the boundary. Our MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors are
shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with singularities. We also
provide results on uniform validity of our CSs over classes of DGPs that
include point and partially identified models. We demonstrate good
finite-sample coverage properties of our procedures in two simulation
experiments. Finally, our procedures are applied to two non-trivial empirical
examples: an airline entry game and a model of trade flows.

    <title>Quantile Graphical Models: Prediction and Conditional Independence with
  Applications to Financial Risk Management</title>
    <summary>  We propose Quantile Graphical Models (QGMs) to characterize predictive and
conditional independence relationships within a set of random variables of
interest. This framework is intended to quantify the dependence in non-Gaussian
settings which are ubiquitous in many econometric applications. We consider two
distinct QGMs. First, Condition Independence QGMs characterize conditional
independence at each quantile index revealing the distributional dependence
structure. Second, Predictive QGMs characterize the best linear predictor under
asymmetric loss functions. Under Gaussianity these notions essentially coincide
but non-Gaussian settings lead us to different models as prediction and
conditional independence are fundamentally different properties. Combined the
models complement the methods based on normal and nonparanormal distributions
that study mean predictability and use covariance and precision matrices for
conditional independence.
  We also propose estimators for each QGMs. The estimators are based on
high-dimension techniques including (a continuum of) $\ell_{1}$-penalized
quantile regressions and low biased equations, which allows us to handle the
potentially large number of variables. We build upon recent results to obtain
valid choice of the penalty parameters and rates of convergence. These results
are derived without any assumptions on the separation from zero and are
uniformly valid across a wide-range of models. With the additional assumptions
that the coefficients are well-separated from zero, we can consistently
estimate the graph associated with the dependence structure by hard
thresholding the proposed estimators. Further we show how QGM can be used in
measuring systemic risk contributions and the impact of downside movement in
the market on the dependence structure of assets' return.

    <title>The Factor-Lasso and K-Step Bootstrap Approach for Inference in
  High-Dimensional Economic Applications</title>
    <summary>  We consider inference about coefficients on a small number of variables of
interest in a linear panel data model with additive unobserved individual and
time specific effects and a large number of additional time-varying confounding
variables. We allow the number of these additional confounding variables to be
larger than the sample size, and suppose that, in addition to unrestricted time
and individual specific effects, these confounding variables are generated by a
small number of common factors and high-dimensional weakly-dependent
disturbances. We allow that both the factors and the disturbances are related
to the outcome variable and other variables of interest. To make informative
inference feasible, we impose that the contribution of the part of the
confounding variables not captured by time specific effects, individual
specific effects, or the common factors can be captured by a relatively small
number of terms whose identities are unknown. Within this framework, we provide
a convenient computational algorithm based on factor extraction followed by
lasso regression for inference about parameters of interest and show that the
resulting procedure has good asymptotic properties. We also provide a simple
k-step bootstrap procedure that may be used to construct inferential statements
about parameters of interest and prove its asymptotic validity. The proposed
bootstrap may be of substantive independent interest outside of the present
context as the proposed bootstrap may readily be adapted to other contexts
involving inference after lasso variable selection and the proof of its
validity requires some new technical arguments. We also provide simulation
evidence about performance of our procedure and illustrate its use in two
empirical applications.

    <title>$L_2$Boosting for Economic Applications</title>
    <summary>  In the recent years more and more high-dimensional data sets, where the
number of parameters $p$ is high compared to the number of observations $n$ or
even larger, are available for applied researchers. Boosting algorithms
represent one of the major advances in machine learning and statistics in
recent years and are suitable for the analysis of such data sets. While Lasso
has been applied very successfully for high-dimensional data sets in Economics,
boosting has been underutilized in this field, although it has been proven very
powerful in fields like Biostatistics and Pattern Recognition. We attribute
this to missing theoretical results for boosting. The goal of this paper is to
fill this gap and show that boosting is a competitive method for inference of a
treatment effect or instrumental variable (IV) estimation in a high-dimensional
setting. First, we present the $L_2$Boosting with componentwise least squares
algorithm and variants which are tailored for regression problems which are the
workhorse for most Econometric problems. Then we show how $L_2$Boosting can be
used for estimation of treatment effects and IV estimation. We highlight the
methods and illustrate them with simulations and empirical examples. For
further results and technical details we refer to Luo and Spindler (2016, 2017)
and to the online supplement of the paper.

    <title>Machine Learning Tests for Effects on Multiple Outcomes</title>
    <summary>  A core challenge in the analysis of experimental data is that the impact of
some intervention is often not entirely captured by a single, well-defined
outcome. Instead there may be a large number of outcome variables that are
potentially affected and of interest. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
approach rooted in machine learning to the problem of testing effects on such
groups of outcome variables. It is based on two simple observations. First, the
'false-positive' problem that a group of outcomes is similar to the concern of
'over-fitting,' which has been the focus of a large literature in statistics
and computer science. We can thus leverage sample-splitting methods from the
machine-learning playbook that are designed to control over-fitting to ensure
that statistical models express generalizable insights about treatment effects.
The second simple observation is that the question whether treatment affects a
group of variables is equivalent to the question whether treatment is
predictable from these variables better than some trivial benchmark (provided
treatment is assigned randomly). This formulation allows us to leverage
data-driven predictors from the machine-learning literature to flexibly mine
for effects, rather than rely on more rigid approaches like multiple-testing
corrections and pre-analysis plans. We formulate a specific methodology and
present three kinds of results: first, our test is exactly sized for the null
hypothesis of no effect; second, a specific version is asymptotically
equivalent to a benchmark joint Wald test in a linear regression; and third,
this methodology can guide inference on where an intervention has effects.
Finally, we argue that our approach can naturally deal with typical features of
real-world experiments, and be adapted to baseline balance checks.

    <title>L1-Penalized Quantile Regression in High-Dimensional Sparse Models</title>
    <summary>  We consider median regression and, more generally, a possibly infinite
collection of quantile regressions in high-dimensional sparse models. In these
models the overall number of regressors $p$ is very large, possibly larger than
the sample size $n$, but only $s$ of these regressors have non-zero impact on
the conditional quantile of the response variable, where $s$ grows slower than
$n$. We consider quantile regression penalized by the $\ell_1$-norm of
coefficients ($\ell_1$-QR). First, we show that $\ell_1$-QR is consistent at
the rate $\sqrt{s/n} \sqrt{\log p}$. The overall number of regressors $p$
affects the rate only through the $\log p$ factor, thus allowing nearly
exponential growth in the number of zero-impact regressors. The rate result
holds under relatively weak conditions, requiring that $s/n$ converges to zero
at a super-logarithmic speed and that regularization parameter satisfies
certain theoretical constraints. Second, we propose a pivotal, data-driven
choice of the regularization parameter and show that it satisfies these
theoretical constraints. Third, we show that $\ell_1$-QR correctly selects the
true minimal model as a valid submodel, when the non-zero coefficients of the
true model are well separated from zero. We also show that the number of
non-zero coefficients in $\ell_1$-QR is of same stochastic order as $s$.
Fourth, we analyze the rate of convergence of a two-step estimator that applies
ordinary quantile regression to the selected model. Fifth, we evaluate the
performance of $\ell_1$-QR in a Monte-Carlo experiment, and illustrate its use
on an international economic growth application.

    <title>Sparse Models and Methods for Optimal Instruments with an Application to
  Eminent Domain</title>
    <summary>  We develop results for the use of Lasso and Post-Lasso methods to form
first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental
variables (IV) models with many instruments, $p$. Our results apply even when
$p$ is much larger than the sample size, $n$. We show that the IV estimator
based on using Lasso or Post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and
asymptotically normal when the first-stage is approximately sparse; i.e. when
the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments
can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose
identities may be unknown. We also show the estimator is semi-parametrically
efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably our results allow
for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic "beta-min"
conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following
model selection. In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a
data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated
many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the
effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the
Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark.
  In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso
and Post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions
which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a
modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic
disturbances which uses a data-weighted $\ell_1$-penalty function. Using
moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence
rates for the resulting Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as
the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition
that $\log p = o(n^{1/3})$.

    <title>Conditional Quantile Processes based on Series or Many Regressors</title>
    <summary>  Quantile regression (QR) is a principal regression method for analyzing the
impact of covariates on outcomes. The impact is described by the conditional
quantile function and its functionals. In this paper we develop the
nonparametric QR-series framework, covering many regressors as a special case,
for performing inference on the entire conditional quantile function and its
linear functionals. In this framework, we approximate the entire conditional
quantile function by a linear combination of series terms with
quantile-specific coefficients and estimate the function-valued coefficients
from the data. We develop large sample theory for the QR-series coefficient
process, namely we obtain uniform strong approximations to the QR-series
coefficient process by conditionally pivotal and Gaussian processes. Based on
these strong approximations, or couplings, we develop four resampling methods
(pivotal, gradient bootstrap, Gaussian, and weighted bootstrap) that can be
used for inference on the entire QR-series coefficient function.
  We apply these results to obtain estimation and inference methods for linear
functionals of the conditional quantile function, such as the conditional
quantile function itself, its partial derivatives, average partial derivatives,
and conditional average partial derivatives. Specifically, we obtain uniform
rates of convergence and show how to use the four resampling methods mentioned
above for inference on the functionals. All of the above results are for
function-valued parameters, holding uniformly in both the quantile index and
the covariate value, and covering the pointwise case as a by-product. We
demonstrate the practical utility of these results with an example, where we
estimate the price elasticity function and test the Slutsky condition of the
individual demand for gasoline, as indexed by the individual unobserved
propensity for gasoline consumption.

    <title>Some New Asymptotic Theory for Least Squares Series: Pointwise and
  Uniform Results</title>
    <summary>  In applications it is common that the exact form of a conditional expectation
is unknown and having flexible functional forms can lead to improvements.
Series method offers that by approximating the unknown function based on $k$
basis functions, where $k$ is allowed to grow with the sample size $n$. We
consider series estimators for the conditional mean in light of: (i) sharp LLNs
for matrices derived from the noncommutative Khinchin inequalities, (ii) bounds
on the Lebesgue factor that controls the ratio between the $L^\infty$ and
$L_2$-norms of approximation errors, (iii) maximal inequalities for processes
whose entropy integrals diverge, and (iv) strong approximations to series-type
processes.
  These technical tools allow us to contribute to the series literature,
specifically the seminal work of Newey (1997), as follows. First, we weaken the
condition on the number $k$ of approximating functions used in series
estimation from the typical $k^2/n \to 0$ to $k/n \to 0$, up to log factors,
which was available only for spline series before. Second, we derive $L_2$
rates and pointwise central limit theorems results when the approximation error
vanishes. Under an incorrectly specified model, i.e. when the approximation
error does not vanish, analogous results are also shown. Third, under stronger
conditions we derive uniform rates and functional central limit theorems that
hold if the approximation error vanishes or not. That is, we derive the strong
approximation for the entire estimate of the nonparametric function.
  We derive uniform rates, Gaussian approximations, and uniform confidence
bands for a wide collection of linear functionals of the conditional
expectation function.

    <title>Gaussian approximations and multiplier bootstrap for maxima of sums of
  high-dimensional random vectors</title>
    <summary>  We derive a Gaussian approximation result for the maximum of a sum of
high-dimensional random vectors. Specifically, we establish conditions under
which the distribution of the maximum is approximated by that of the maximum of
a sum of the Gaussian random vectors with the same covariance matrices as the
original vectors. This result applies when the dimension of random vectors
($p$) is large compared to the sample size ($n$); in fact, $p$ can be much
larger than $n$, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these
vectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the
random vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated
by the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random
vectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d. Gaussian
multipliers. This is the Gaussian multiplier (or wild) bootstrap procedure.
Here too, $p$ can be large or even much larger than $n$. These distributional
approximations, either Gaussian or conditional Gaussian, yield a high-quality
approximation to the distribution of the original maximum, often with
approximation error decreasing polynomially in the sample size, and hence are
of interest in many applications. We demonstrate how our Gaussian
approximations and the multiplier bootstrap can be used for modern
high-dimensional estimation, multiple hypothesis testing, and adaptive
specification testing. All these results contain nonasymptotic bounds on
approximation errors.

    <title>Valid Post-Selection and Post-Regularization Inference: An Elementary,
  General Approach</title>
    <summary>  Here we present an expository, general analysis of valid post-selection or
post-regularization inference about a low-dimensional target parameter,
$\alpha$, in the presence of a very high-dimensional nuisance parameter,
$\eta$, which is estimated using modern selection or regularization methods.
Our analysis relies on high-level, easy-to-interpret conditions that allow one
to clearly see the structures needed for achieving valid post-regularization
inference. Simple, readily verifiable sufficient conditions are provided for a
class of affine-quadratic models. We focus our discussion on estimation and
inference procedures based on using the empirical analog of theoretical
equations $$M(\alpha, \eta)=0$$ which identify $\alpha$. Within this structure,
we show that setting up such equations in a manner such that the
orthogonality/immunization condition $$\partial_\eta M(\alpha, \eta) = 0$$ at
the true parameter values is satisfied, coupled with plausible conditions on
the smoothness of $M$ and the quality of the estimator $\hat \eta$, guarantees
that inference on for the main parameter $\alpha$ based on testing or point
estimation methods discussed below will be regular despite selection or
regularization biases occurring in estimation of $\eta$. In particular, the
estimator of $\alpha$ will often be uniformly consistent at the root-$n$ rate
and uniformly asymptotically normal even though estimators $\hat \eta$ will
generally not be asymptotically linear and regular. The uniformity holds over
large classes of models that do not impose highly implausible "beta-min"
conditions. We also show that inference can be carried out by inverting tests
formed from Neyman's $C(\alpha)$ (orthogonal score) statistics.

    <title>Optimal Sup-norm Rates and Uniform Inference on Nonlinear Functionals of
  Nonparametric IV Regression</title>
    <summary>  This paper makes several important contributions to the literature about
nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) estimation and inference on a
structural function $h_0$ and its functionals. First, we derive sup-norm
convergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series 2SLS)
estimators of $h_0$ and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that
describes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating $h_0$ and
its derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax
rates when $h_0$ is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal
sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates
for severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than
the optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we
use our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong
approximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for
collections of nonlinear functionals of $h_0$ under primitive conditions,
allowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications,
we obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for
plug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss
(DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated
via sieve NPIV. Empiricists could read our real data application of UCBs for
exact CS and DL functionals of gasoline demand that reveals interesting
patterns and is applicable to other markets.

    <title>Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Causal Parameters</title>
    <summary>  Most modern supervised statistical/machine learning (ML) methods are
explicitly designed to solve prediction problems very well. Achieving this goal
does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of
causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression
coefficients, average treatment effects, average lifts, and demand or supply
elasticities. In fact, estimates of such causal parameters obtained via naively
plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave
very poorly due to the regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization
bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools.
Specifically, we can form an orthogonal score for the target low-dimensional
parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The score is then
used to build a de-biased estimator of the target parameter which typically
will converge at the fastest possible 1/root(n) rate and be approximately
unbiased and normal, and from which valid confidence intervals for these
parameters of interest may be constructed. The resulting method thus could be
called a "double ML" method because it relies on estimating primary and
auxiliary predictive models. In order to avoid overfitting, our construction
also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross-fitting.
This allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the
auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forest, lasso, ridge,
deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregators of
these methods.
